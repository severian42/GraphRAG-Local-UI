Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

This definition is based on the perspectives of authors such as Gamage and Hyde [15]; Hsiao and Chou [20]; Volstad and Boks [21]. Aiming, therefore, to\n\n\n\n\n\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 61\n\n3 of 16\n\naid the grounding, guiding, planning, creation, and evaluation of biomimetic productions in this field, the general objective of this article was to identify, describe and analyze the contributions of biomimicry to design based on a survey of publications indexed in the Web of Science database.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\nThe investigation was carried out in the Web of Science database, using the descriptors biomimicry and design. The period between 1991 and 2021 was configured as the time range for the searches, totaling three decades. It should be noted that the first decade of this interval coincides with the publication of the work by Benyus, Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature, which contributed to the dissemination of the term \u201cbiomimicry\u201d [22].\n\nTo carry out the systematic review, the Theory of Consolidated Meta-Analytical Approach (TEMAC) integrative model was adopted. This resource recommends organizing the information collected in the database according to areas of knowledge, countries, journals, institutions, authors, and years. In addition, TEMAC guides the performance of citation, co-citation, coupling, co-occurrence, and word cloud analyses with the generation of images, such as heat maps and network or line maps. For this purpose, the VOSViewer and TagCrowd platforms were used [23].\n\nIt is worth clarifying that citation analysis is one of the means of measuring the impact of authors\u2019 production based on the number of citations listed in the database. Evidently, it is important not to mistake the popularity of an author or publication with the relevance of the scientific work developed, but it is an interesting comparative parameter. The co-citation analysis corresponds to works that are frequently cited together by other publications.\n\nThe greater the number of co-citations of a document, the greater its prominence in the literature, and the more likely its semantic relationship with the other two documents will be.
