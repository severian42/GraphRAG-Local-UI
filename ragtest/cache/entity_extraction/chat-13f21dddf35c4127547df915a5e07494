{"result": " The text provided is an academic article about the use of biomimicry in design, specifically focusing on how it contributes to various fields and areas of knowledge. The authors, Alice Araujo Marques de S\u00e1 and Dianne Magalh\u00e3es Viana, conducted a systematic review to analyze the impact of biomimicry on design.\n\nThe article highlights that biomimicry can stimulate creativity in design by providing innovative ideas based on natural structures and systems. It also emphasizes the potential integration of sustainability into production cycles through biomimetic design. The authors note a tendency for problem-based approaches in research related to biomimicry.\n\nThe article is relevant to the conversation about an unknown intelligence writing its own rules, as it demonstrates how interdisciplinary knowledge can lead to innovative solutions and creative potentials. In the context of first contact with an unknown intelligence, understanding and adapting to their unique characteristics might require a similar approach \u2013 drawing on diverse fields of knowledge to develop innovative strategies for communication and interaction.\n\nIn terms of relationships:\n- \"Biomimicry\" is related to \"Design\" as it provides insights and tools for the creation of innovative designs inspired by nature.\n- \"Creativity\" is related to both \"Design\" and \"Biomimicry\" as they both stimulate creative thinking and problem-solving.\n- \"Sustainability\" is related to \"Design\" and \"Biomimicry\" as biomimetic design can help implement sustainability in production cycles.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Thus, a systematic review was undertaken to identify, describe, and analyze the contributions of biomimicry to design. For this purpose, the integrative systematic review model, called the Theory of Consolidated Meta-Analytical Approach, was used, carrying out a search on the Web of Science with the descriptors \u201cdesign\u201d and \u201cbiomimicry\u201d. For the period from 1991 to 2021, 196 publications were retrieved. The results were organized according to areas of knowledge, countries, journals, institutions, authors, and years. Citation, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling analyses were also performed. The investigation highlighted the following research emphases: the conception of products, buildings, and environments; the exploration of natural structures and systems to create materials and technologies; the use of biomimetic creative tools in product design; and projects focused on saving resources and implementing sustainability. It was noted that there was a tendency for authors to adopt a problem-based approach. It was concluded that the study of biomimicry can stimulate the development of multiple skills in design, improving creativity, and enhancing the potential integration of sustainability into production cycles.\n\nKeywords: design; biomimicry; biomimetic design; systematic review; bio-inspiration; bionics; bio-inspired design; nature-inspired design; bio-informed design; sustainability Citation: S\u00e1, A.A.M.d.; Viana, D.M.\n\nDesign and Biomimicry: A Review of\n\nInterconnections and Creative\n\n1.
