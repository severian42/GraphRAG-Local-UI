{"result": " In this text, the main focus is on a literature review about Biomimetics in 2023. The author used software like VOSViewer and TagCrowd to analyze the data and visualize the results. They mention that while Web of Science is a good multidisciplinary repository, it primarily covers English content and does not have a specific filter for the design field. Therefore, they suggest investigating other multilingual repositories like Scopus, Google Scholar, EBSCO, ProQuest.\n\nThe author also mentions that future reviews could incorporate more descriptors such as bioinspiration, bionics, biodesign, biomimetic design, and others to broaden the scope of the research.\n\nIn terms of entities:\n- \"Biomimetics 2023\" is an event (conference or journal)\n- \"VOSViewer\", \"TagCrowd\" are software concepts\n- \"Web of Science\", \"Scopus\", \"Google Scholar\", \"EBSCO\", \"ProQuest\" are geo (database or platform) concepts\n- \"MAXQDA\", \"CiteSpace\", \"Publish or Perish\", \"SankeyMATIc\", \"Bibexcel\", \"Gephi\", \"Pajek\", \"Ucinet\", \"Sci2\" are software concepts\n\nRelationships:\n- The author used VOSViewer and TagCrowd to analyze the data from Biomimetics 2023.\n- The author suggests investigating other databases like Scopus, Google Scholar, EBSCO, ProQuest in future research.\n- Future reviews could incorporate more descriptors like bioinspiration, bionics, biodesign, etc.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Through it, it was possible to infer which areas are expanding and which deserve to be further investigated. The tool also allowed comparisons to be made between the works and production of different authors, countries, and institutions.\n\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 61\n\n13 of 16\n\nIn addition, the recommendation of TEMAC to adopt software, such as VOSViewer and TagCrowd, enabled the graphical representation of the results (e.g., heat maps and line maps), which facilitated carrying out the analyses, in addition to illustrating them satis-factorily. However, like any procedure for surveying and analyzing the literature, it is crucial to understand that, from the moment specifications are established for the research themes, descriptors, software, databases, and filters that will be used, it is inevitable that certain works will not be captured by the selected criteria, which can limit the scope of the contributions of a review such as the present work.\n\nThe chosen database for this research (Web of Science) is one of the main multidisci-plinary repositories, having an excellent temporal coverage of publications, in addition to ensuring a frequent update of indexed works, including complementary materials such as conference proceedings [19]. Nevertheless, the Web of Science mainly covers content published in English and, as discussed earlier, there is no specific filtering function for the field of design. Thus, the investigation of other multilingual repositories, such as Scopus, Google Scholar, EBSCO, ProQuest [19, 47] is recommended. Furthermore, when analyzing other systematic reviews, it is noticeable that other software and platforms, in addition to those employed in the present review, have been used by authors to organize and facilitate data processing. Some examples are: MAXQDA, CiteSpace, Publish or Perish, San-keyMATIc, Bibexcel, Gephi, Pajek, Ucinet, and Science of Science (Sci2) [47\u201349].\n\nThe adoption of the descriptors biomimicry and design was sufficient to achieve the objectives proposed in the scope of this research. However, considering that only two descriptors were used, it is suggested that more terms be incorporated in future surveys, such as: bioinspiration, biomimetics, bionics, biodesign, biomimetic design, bioinspired design, bionic design, nature-based design, nature-inspired design, biologically-inspired design, and bio-informed design. Thus, it will be possible\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral:7b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
