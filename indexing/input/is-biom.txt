‚ÄúMagnetic‚Äù termite mound surfaces are oriented to suit wind and shade conditions,SummaryThe termites Amitermes meridionalis and A. laurensis construct remarkable meridional or ‚Äúmagnetic‚Äù mounds in northern Australia. These mounds vary geographically in mean orientation in a manner that suggests such variation is an adaptive response to local environmental conditions. Theoretical modelling of solar irradiance and mound rotation experiments show that maintenance of an eastern face temperature plateau during the dry season is the most likely physical basis for the mound orientation response. Subsequent heat transfer analysis shows that habitat wind speed and shading conditions also affect face temperature gradients such as the rate of eastern face temperature change. It is then demonstrated that the geographic variation in mean mound orientation follows the geographic variation in long-term wind speed and shading conditions across northern Australia such that an eastern face temperature plateau is maintained in all locations.,TRUE

A bio-inspired visual collision detection mechanism for cars: Optimisation of a model of a locust neuron to a novel environment,"The lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) neuron of locusts has been shown to preferentially respond to objects approaching the eye of a locust on a direct collision course. Computer simulations of the neuron have been developed and have demonstrated the ability of mobile robots, interfaced with a simulated LGMD model, to avoid collisions. In this study, a model of the LGMD neuron is presented and the functional parameters of the model identified. Models with different parameters were presented with a range of automotive video sequences, including collisions with cars. The parameters were optimised to respond correctly to the video sequences using a range of genetic algorithms (GAs). The model evolved most rapidly using GAs with high clone rates into a form suitable for detecting collisions with cars and not producing false collision alerts to most non-collision scenes.",TRUE
A Biological Screw in a Beetle‚Äôs Leg,Joints on the legs of weevils form a functional screw-and-nut system. The coxa-trochanteral joints on the legs of the weevil Trigonopterus oblongus (Pascoe) work as a biological screw-and-nut system. The apical portions of the coxae closely resemble nuts with well-defined inner threads covering 345¬∞. The corresponding trochanters have perfectly compatible external spiral threads of 410¬∞.,TRUE
A Biological Solution to a Fundamental Distributed Computing Problem,"Modeling of development in the fruit fly yields an algorithm useful in designing wireless communication networks. Computational and biological systems are often distributed so that processors (cells) jointly solve a task, without any of them receiving all inputs or observing all outputs. Maximal independent set (MIS) selection is a fundamental distributed computing procedure that seeks to elect a set of local leaders in a network. A variant of this problem is solved during the development of the fly‚Äôs nervous system, when sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells are chosen. By studying SOP selection, we derived a fast algorithm for MIS selection that combines two attractive features. First, processors do not need to know their degree; second, it has an optimal message complexity while only using one-bit messages. Our findings suggest that simple and efficient algorithms can be developed on the basis of biologically derived insights.",TRUE
A biological sub-micron thickness optical broadband reflector characterized using both light and microwaves,"Broadband optical reflectors generally function through coherent scattering from systems comprising one of three designs: overlapped; chirped; or chaotic multilayer reflectors. For each, the requirement to scatter a broad band of wavelengths is met through the presence of a variation in nanostructural periodicity running perpendicular to the systems' outer surfaces. Consequently, the requisite total thickness of the multilayer can often be in excess of 50‚ÄäŒºm. Here, we report the discovery and the microwave-assisted characterization of a natural system that achieves excellent optical broadband reflectivity but that is less than 1‚ÄäŒºm thick. This system, found on the wing scales of the butterfly Argyrophorus argenteus, comprises a distinctive variation in periodicity that runs parallel to the reflecting surface, rather than perpendicular to it. In this way, the requirement for an extensively thick system is removed.",TRUE
A branched material based on biomimetic design: Synthesis and electrochemical properties,"Based on the biomimetic route the metal material with tree-like fractal structure was prepared, which showed a rough surface observed by scanning electron microscopy. According to the electrochemical experiments, the formed material exhibited the strong catalytic capability as an electrode in hydrogen evolution reaction, comparing with other conventional structure materials under comparable scales. We suggested this promotion of property arose from the contribution of the great surface area and the excellent connectivity offered from the fractal structure. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A buckling region in locust hindlegs contains resilin and absorbs energy when jumping or kicking goes wrong,"If a hindleg of a locust slips during jumping, or misses its target during kicking, energy generated by the two extensor tibiae muscles is no longer expended in raising the body or striking a target. How, then, is the energy in a jump (4100‚Äì4800 ŒºJ) or kick (1700 ŒºJ) dissipated? A specialised buckling region found in the proximal hind-tibia where the bending moment is high, but not present in the other legs, buckled and allowed the distal part of the tibia to extend. In jumps when a hindleg slipped, it bent by a mean of 23¬±14 deg at a velocity of 13.4¬±9.5 deg ms‚Äì1; in kicks that failed to contact a target it bent by 32¬±16 deg at a velocity of 32.9¬±9.5 deg ms‚Äì1. It also buckled 8.5¬±4.0 deg at a rate of 0.063¬±0.005 deg ms‚Äì1 when the tibia was prevented from flexing fully about the femur in preparation for both these movements. By experimentally buckling this region through 40 deg at velocities of 0.001‚Äì0.65 deg ms‚Äì1, we showed that one hindleg could store about 870 ŒºJ on bending, of which 210 ŒºJ was dissipated back to the leg on release. A band of blue fluorescence was revealed at the buckling region under UV illumination that had the two key signatures of the elastic protein resilin. A group of campaniform sensilla 300 Œºm proximal to the buckling region responded to imposed buckling movements. The features of the buckling region show that it can act as a shock absorber as proposed previously when jumping and kicking movements go wrong.",TRUE
A Clerodane Diterpene from Callicarpa americana Resensitizes Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus to √ü-Lactam Antibiotics.,"The rise of antibiotic resistance presents a significant healthcare challenge and precludes the use of many otherwise valuable antibiotics. One potential solution to this problem is the use of antibiotics in combination with resistance-modifying agents, compounds that act synergistically with existing antibiotics to resensitize previously resistant bacteria. In this study, 12(S),16Œæ-dihydroxycleroda-3,13-dien-15,16-olide, a clerodane diterpene isolated from the medicinal plant Callicarpa americana, was found to synergize with oxacillin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This synergy was confirmed by checkerboard (FICI = 0.125) and time-kill assays, with a sub-inhibitory dose of 12(S),16Œæ-dihydroxycleroda-3,13-dien-15,16-olide causing the effective concentration of oxacillin to fall below the susceptibility breakpoint for S. aureus, a > 32-fold decrease in both cases.",TRUE
A conserved spider silk domain acts as a molecular switch that controls fibre assembly,"A huge variety of proteins are able to form fibrillar structures, especially at high protein concentrations. Hence, it is surprising that spider silk proteins can be stored in a soluble form at high concentrations and transformed into extremely stable fibres on demand. Silk proteins are reminiscent of amphiphilic block copolymers containing stretches of polyalanine and glycine-rich polar elements forming a repetitive core flanked by highly conserved non-repetitive amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain comprises a secretion signal, but further functions remain unassigned. The C-terminal domain was implicated in the control of solubility and fibre formation initiated by changes in ionic composition and mechanical stimuli known to align the repetitive sequence elements and promote Œ≤-sheet formation. However, despite recent structural data, little is known about this remarkable behaviour in molecular detail. Here we present the solution structure of the C-terminal domain of a spider dragline silk protein and provide evidence that the structural state of this domain is essential for controlled switching between the storage and assembly forms of silk proteins. In addition, the C-terminal domain also has a role in the alignment of secondary structural features formed by the repetitive elements in the backbone of spider silk proteins, which is known to be important for the mechanical properties of the fibre.",TRUE
A Cultured Greigite-Producing Magnetotactic Bacterium in a Novel Group of Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria,"The crystal structure of biomineralized magnetic nanocrystals depends on environmental and genetic factors. Magnetotactic bacteria contain magnetosomes‚Äîintracellular, membrane-bounded, magnetic nanocrystals of magnetite (Fe3O4) or greigite (Fe3S4)‚Äîthat cause the bacteria to swim along geomagnetic field lines. We isolated a greigite-producing magnetotactic bacterium from a brackish spring in Death Valley National Park, California, USA, strain BW-1, that is able to biomineralize greigite and magnetite depending on culture conditions. A phylogenetic comparison of BW-1 and similar uncultured greigite- and/or magnetite-producing magnetotactic bacteria from freshwater to hypersaline habitats shows that these organisms represent a previously unknown group of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the Deltaproteobacteria. Genomic analysis of BW-1 reveals the presence of two different magnetosome gene clusters, suggesting that one may be responsible for greigite biomineralization and the other for magnetite.",TRUE
A dinoflagellate exploits toxins to immobilize prey prior to ingestion,"Toxins produced by the harmful algal bloom (HAB) forming, mixotrophic dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum have long been associated with fish kills. To date, the perceived ecological role for toxins has been relief from grazing pressures. Here, we demonstrate that karlotoxins also serve as a predation instrument. Using high-speed holographic microscopy, we measure the swimming behavior of several toxic and nontoxic strains of K. veneficum and their prey, Storeatula major, within dense suspensions. The selected strains produce toxins with varying potency and dosages, including a nontoxic one. Results clearly show that mixing the prey with the predatory, toxic strains causes prey immobilization at rates that are consistent with the karlotoxins‚Äô potency and dosage. Even prey cells that continue swimming slow down after exposure to toxic predators. The swimming characteristics of predators vary substantially in pure suspensions, as quantified by their velocity, radii of helical trajectories, and direction of helical rotation. When mixed with prey, all toxic strains that are involved in predation slow down. Furthermore, they substantially reduced their predominantly vertical migration, presumably to remain in the vicinity of their prey. Conversely, the nontoxic control strain does not alter its swimming and does not affect prey behavior. In separate experiments, we show that exposing prey to exogenous toxins also causes prey immobilization at rates consistent with potency. Clearly, the toxic predatory strains use karlotoxins as a means of stunning their prey, before ingesting it. These findings add a substantiated critical understanding for why some HAB species produce such complex toxin molecules.",TRUE
A dynamic broadband reflector built from microscopic silica spheres in the ‚Äòdisco‚Äô clam Ctenoides ales,"The ‚Äòdisco‚Äô or ‚Äòelectric‚Äô clam Ctenoides ales (Limidae) is the only species of bivalve known to have a behaviourally mediated photic display. This display is so vivid that it has been repeatedly confused for bioluminescence, but it is actually the result of scattered light. The flashing occurs on the mantle lip, where electron microscopy revealed two distinct tissue sides: one highly scattering side that contains dense aggregations of spheres composed of silica, and one highly absorbing side that does not. High-speed video confirmed that the two sides act in concert to alternate between vivid broadband reflectance and strong absorption in the blue region of the spectrum. Optical modelling suggests that the diameter of the spheres is nearly optimal for scattering visible light, especially at shorter wavelengths which predominate in their environment. This simple mechanism produces a striking optical effect that may function as a signal.",TRUE
A finite element simulation scheme for biological muscular hydrostats.,"An explicit finite element scheme is developed for biological muscular hydrostats such as squid tentacles, octopus arms and elephant trunks. The scheme is implemented by embedding muscle fibers in finite elements. In any given element, the fiber orientation can be assigned arbitrarily and multiple muscle directions can be simulated. The mechanical stress in each muscle fiber is the sum of active and passive parts. The active stress is taken to be a function of activation state, muscle fiber shortening velocity and fiber strain; while the passive stress depends only on the strain. This scheme is tested by simulating extension of a squid tentacle during prey capture; our numerical predictions are in close correspondence with existing experimental results. It is shown that the present finite element scheme can successfully simulate more complex behaviors such as torsion of a squid tentacle and the bending behavior of octopus arms or elephant trunks.",TRUE
A functional interpretation of cilia and mucocyte distributions on the abfrontal surface of bivalve gills,"Abstract The lack of fundamental data on the abfrontal surface of bivalve gills has prompted a comparative study of cilia and mucocytes on this surface, using scanning electron microscopy and histology on eight species of bivalves, representing seven families and the four major gill types: Mytilus edulis, Modiolus modiolus, Arca zebra, Placopecten magellanicus, Crassostrea virginica, Spisula solidissima, Mercenaria mercenaria, and Mya arenaria. Abfrontal cilia and mucocytes were found in all species studied, with types and densities differing within and between gill types. The three species of homorhabdic filibranchs presented different densities of abfrontal cilia and mucocytes, from very dense in M. edulis to sparse in A. zebra. The heterorhabdic gills had intermediate cilia and mucocyte densities, with highest concentrations of both abfrontal cilia and mucocytes on the principal filaments. The eulamellibranchs showed low ciliary densities together with high mucocyte densities, especially in S. solidissima, where the abfrontal mucocytes were glandular. These results indicate that: (1) the abfrontal surface is a vestigial mucociliary surface; (2) the abfrontal surface cannot participate in water pumping in most species, due to low ciliary densities; and (3) species with high densities of abfrontal mucocytes could utilize abfrontal mucus to reduce drag, especially in the highly fused gills, such as those of the eulamellibranchs. The differing distributions of abfrontal cilia and mucocytes may reflect different selective pressures acting on the gills within the various taxa.",TRUE
A honey bee odorant receptor for the queen substance 9-oxo-2-decenoic acid,"By using a functional genomics approach, we have identified a honey bee [Apis mellifera (Am)] odorant receptor (Or) for the queen substance 9-oxo-2-decenoic acid (9-ODA). Honey bees live in large eusocial colonies in which a single queen is responsible for reproduction, several thousand sterile female worker bees complete a myriad of tasks to maintain the colony, and several hundred male drones exist only to mate. The ‚Äúqueen substance‚Äù [also termed the queen retinue pheromone (QRP)] is an eight-component pheromone that maintains the queen's dominance in the colony. The main component, 9-ODA, acts as a releaser pheromone by attracting workers to the queen and as a primer pheromone by physiologically inhibiting worker ovary development; it also acts as a sex pheromone, attracting drones during mating flights. However, the extent to which social and sexual chemical messages are shared remains unresolved. By using a custom chemosensory-specific microarray and qPCR, we identified four candidate sex pheromone Ors (AmOr10, -11, -18, and -170) from the honey bee genome based on their biased expression in drone antennae. We assayed the pheromone responsiveness of these receptors by using Xenopus oocytes and electrophysiology. AmOr11 responded specifically to 9-ODA (EC50 = 280 ¬± 31 nM) and not to any of the other seven QRP components, other social pheromones, or floral odors. We did not observe any responses of the other three Ors to any of the eight QRP pheromone components, suggesting 9-ODA is the only QRP component that also acts as a long-distance sex pheromone.",TRUE
"A lightweight, biological structure with tailored stiffness: The feather vane.","UNLABELLEDThe flying feathers of birds are keratinous appendages designed for maximum performance with a minimum weight penalty. Thus, their design contains ingenious combinations of components that optimize lift, stiffness, aerodynamics, and damage resistance. This design involves two main parts: a central shaft that prescribes stiffness and lateral vanes which allows for the capture of air. Within the feather vane, barbs branch from the shaft and barbules branch from barbs, forming a flat surface which ensures lift. Microhooks at the end of barbules hold barbs tightly together, providing the close-knit, unified structure of the feather vane and enabling a repair of the structure through the reattachment of un-hooked junctions. Both the shaft and barbs are lightweight biological structures constructed of keratin using the common motif of a solid shell and cellular interior. The cellular core increases the resistance to buckling with little added weight. Here we analyze the detailed structure of the feather barb and, for the first time, explain its flexural stiffness in terms of the mechanics of asymmetric foam-filled beams subjected to bending. The results are correlated and validated with finite element modeling. We compare the flexure of single barbs as well as arrays of barbs and find that the interlocking adherence of barbs to one another enables a more robust structure due to minimized barb rotation during deflection. Thus, the flexure behavior of the feather vane can be tailored by the adhesive hooking between barbs, creating a system that mitigates damage. A simplified three-dimensional physical model for this interlocking mechanism is constructed by additive manufacturing. The exceptional architecture of the feather vane will motivate the design of bioinspired structures with tailored and unique properties ranging from adhesives to aerospace materials.STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEDespite its importance to bird flight, literature characterizing the feather vane is extremely limited. The feather vane is composed of barbs that branch from the main shaft (rachis) and barbules that branch from barbs. In this study, the flexural behavior of the feather barb and the role of barbule connections in reinforcing the feather vane are quantitatively investigated for the first time, both experimentally and theoretically. Through the performed experiments, structure-function relationships within the feather vane are uncovered. Additionally, in the proposed model the sophisticated structure of the barbs and the interlocking mechanism of the feather vane are simplified to understand these processes in order to engineer new lightweight structures and adhesives.",TRUE
A Literal Elytral Rainbow: Tunable Structural Colors Using Single Diamond Biophotonic Crystals in Pachyrrhynchus congestus Weevils.,"The brilliant colors of many insects arise from the interference of incident light with complex nanostructured biomaterials that are present in their cuticle. Here, the rainbow-colored spots on the elytra of a snout weevil, Pachyrrhynchus congestus pavonius (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), are investigated using synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering, scanning electron microscopy, microspectrophotometry, and photonic bandgap modeling. It is shown that the iridescent scales present in the rainbow-hued spots are due to a 3D photonic crystal network of chitin in air with a single diamond (Fd-3m) symmetry. In many insects, different orientations of photonic crystal domains are used to create various hues. In this weevil, however, both the chitin volume fractions as well as the lattice parameters of the biologically self-assembled single diamond nanostructure are varied to achieve the remarkable tuning of the structural colors across the visible light spectrum on a scale-by-scale basis. Uncovering the precise mechanism of color tuning employed by this weevil has important implications for further structural and developmental research on biophotonic nanostructures and may provide fresh impetus for bioinspired and biomimetic multifunctional applications, as synthesis of photonic crystals at visible length scales is currently challenging.",TRUE
A method for characterizing and mimicking forest canopy gaps caused by different disturbances,"Forest canopy gaps are measurable indicators of past small-scale disturbances. These disturbances can impact forest stand dynamics in ways that help maintain and enhance many ecosystem values. Impacts are commonly assessed using timber production metrics based on average stand values, but metrics based on smaller scales are needed to assess impacts on nontimber resources. In this study, we developed a multivariate method of quantitatively characterizing individual canopy gaps in Douglas-fir/grand fir stands in the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon. We then established a reference or target range of variability by profiling gaps according to numbers of snags, downed logs, gap size and shape, and recolonizing vegetation. Cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling, and classification trees were used with these profiles to quantify similarity among individual gaps. Gaps fell into four groups, which could be interpreted as three ecologically functional groups on the basis of their role in stand development. Gaps caused by the same agents commonly fell within the same functional group: (1) flooding, logging, spruce budworm, and windfall cause stand level impacts that reset the stand development sequence; (2) bark beetles, tree fall, and root diseases cause within stand impacts that altered the rate of stand development; and (3) stem decay and dwarf mistletoe, and, under some circumstances, all disturbance agents, could kill trees yet have no impact on stand development except create space into which neighboring trees expand. We present a simple test to monitor how gaps change with silvicultural manipulations. Results indicate that this method offers (1) a way to systematically guide silvicultural manipulations aimed at mimicking natural disturbances at the canopy gap scale, and (2) a way to monitor the effectiveness of such silvicultural treatments and management actions using gap-based silviculture prescriptions.",TRUE
A new perspective on radiation resistance based on Deinococcus radiodurans,"In classical models of radiation toxicity, DNA is the molecule that is most affected by ionizing radiation (IR). However, recent data show that the amount of protein damage caused during irradiation of bacteria is better related to survival than to DNA damage. In this Opinion article, a new model is presented in which proteins are the most important target in the hierarchy of macromolecules affected by IR. A first line of defence against IR in extremely radiation-resistant bacteria might be the accumulation of manganese complexes, which can prevent the production of iron-dependent reactive oxygen species. This would allow an irradiated cell to protect sufficient enzymatic activity needed to repair DNA and survive.",TRUE
"A nocturnal mammal, the greater mouse-eared bat, calibrates a magnetic compass by the sun","Recent evidence suggests that bats can detect the geomagnetic field, but the way in which this is used by them for navigation to a home roost remains unresolved. The geomagnetic field may be used by animals both to indicate direction and to locate position. In birds, directional information appears to be derived from an interaction of the magnetic field with either the sun or the stars, with some evidence suggesting that sunset/sunrise provides the primary directional reference by which a magnetic compass is calibrated daily. We demonstrate that homing greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) calibrate a magnetic compass with sunset cues by testing their homing response after exposure to an altered magnetic field at and after sunset. Magnetic manipulation at sunset resulted in a counterclockwise shift in orientation compared with controls, consistent with sunset calibration of the magnetic field, whereas magnetic manipulation after sunset resulted in no change in orientation. Unlike in birds, however, the pattern of polarization was not necessary for the calibration. For animals that occupy ecological niches where the sunset is rarely observed, this is a surprising finding. Yet it may indicate the primacy of the sun as an absolute geographical reference not only for birds but also within other vertebrate taxa.",TRUE
A nonprotein thermal hysteresis-producing xylomannan antifreeze in the freeze-tolerant Alaskan beetle Upis ceramboides,"Thermal hysteresis (TH), a difference between the melting and freezing points of a solution that is indicative of the presence of large-molecular-mass antifreezes (e.g., antifreeze proteins), has been described in animals, plants, bacteria, and fungi. Although all previously described TH-producing biomolecules are proteins, most thermal hysteresis factors (THFs) have not yet been structurally characterized, and none have been characterized from a freeze-tolerant animal. We isolated a highly active THF from the freeze-tolerant beetle, Upis ceramboides, by means of ice affinity. Amino acid chromatographic analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and NMR spectroscopy indicated that the THF contained little or no protein, yet it produced 3.7 ¬± 0.3 ¬∞C of TH at 5 mg/ml, comparable to that of the most active insect antifreeze proteins. Compositional and structural analyses indicated that this antifreeze contains a Œ≤-mannopyranosyl-(1‚Üí4) Œ≤-xylopyranose backbone and a fatty acid component, although the lipid may not be covalently linked to the saccharide. Consistent with the proposed structure, treatment with endo-Œ≤-(1‚Üí4)xylanase ablated TH activity. This xylomannan is the first TH-producing antifreeze isolated from a freeze-tolerant animal and the first in a new class of highly active THFs that contain little or no protein.",TRUE
A novel marine silk,"The discovery of a novel silk production system in a marine amphipod provides insights into the wider potential of natural silks. The tube-building corophioid amphipod Crassicorophium bonellii produces from its legs fibrous, adhesive underwater threads that combine barnacle cement biology with aspects of spider silk thread extrusion spinning. We characterised the filamentous silk as a mixture of mucopolysaccharides and protein deriving from glands representing two distinct types. The carbohydrate and protein silk secretion is dominated by complex Œ≤-sheet structures and a high content of charged amino acid residues. The filamentous secretion product exits the gland through a pore near the tip of the secretory leg after having moved through a duct, which subdivides into several small ductules all terminating in a spindle-shaped chamber. This chamber communicates with the exterior and may be considered the silk reservoir and processing/mixing space, in which the silk is mechanically and potentially chemically altered and becomes fibrous. We assert that further study of this probably independently evolved, marine arthropod silk processing and secretion system can provide not only important insights into the more complex arachnid and insect silks but also into crustacean adhesion cements.",TRUE
A novel stiffening factor inducing the stiffest state of holothurian catch connective tissue,"SUMMARY The dermis of sea cucumbers is a catch connective tissue or mutable collagenous tissue that shows large changes in stiffness. Extensive studies on the dermis revealed that it can adopt three different states having different mechanical properties that can be reversibly converted. These are the stiff, standard and soft states. The standard state is readily produced when a dermal piece is immersed in the sea water containing Ca2+, whereas the soft state can be produced by removal of Ca2+. A stiffening protein, tensilin, has been isolated from some sea cucumbers (Cucumaria frondosa and Holothuria leucospilota). Although tensilin converts the state of the dermis from soft to standard, it cannot convert from standard to stiff. In this study, we isolated and partially purified a novel stiffening factor from the dermis of Holothuria leucospilota. The factor stiffened the dermis in normal artificial sea water (ASW) but did not stiffen the soft dermis in Ca2+-free ASW. It also stiffened the dermis that had been converted to the standard state in Ca2+-free ASW by the action of tensilin. These results suggest that the factor produces the stiff dermis from the standard state but cannot work as a stiffener on the soft dermis. Its addition to longitudinal muscles of the sea cucumber produced no effects, suggesting that its effect is specific to the catch connective tissue. Its stiffening activity was susceptible to trypsin, meaning that it is a polypeptide, and its molecular mass estimated from gel filtration chromatography was 2.4 kDa.",TRUE
A Passionate Free Climber: Structural Development and Functional Morphology of the Adhesive Tendrils in Passiflora discophora,"Premise of research.‚ÄÉPassiflora discophora is exceptional among passion flowers for its climbing strategy, using branched tendrils with terminal adhesive pads instead of coiling tendrils as typical within this family. This article investigates the structural development and morphology of these adhesive pads and aims to understand the underlying structure-function relationship of the attachment process. Based on our results, we discuss possible mechanical consequences of the tendril structure and compare our findings with similar attachment systems in unrelated species in order to identify general strategies of this mode of attachment. Methodology.‚ÄÉWe investigated the temporal development of the attachment process, including detailed studies of the morphology and anatomy of the adhesive pads, using LM with different staining procedures and SEM. Pivotal results.‚ÄÉYoung tendrils establish initial contact with a supporting substrate by interlocking with their hook-shaped tips. Touch stimuli induce the tips to develop into adhesive pads by callus-like growth of papillate epidermal cells. Fully grown pads are hemispherical on flat substrates or completely fill out larger cavities of the substrate. By apical cell division, the pad tissue perfectly mimics the microtopography of the substrate and also grows into minute gaps and fissures, establishing firm anchorage by optimal form closure. Additionally, an extracellular substance is visible at the interface between pad and substrate surface, which might act as adhesive. Conclusions.‚ÄÉThe opportunistic growth and cellular structure make the tendrils and adhesive pads of P. discophora a highly adaptive attachment system. Comparison with other not closely related taxa reveals general principles of this climbing mode, namely, (1) branched tendrils with multiple adhesive pads, (2) papillate cells establishing optimal form closure with the substrate and in some species additionally secreting adhesive substances, (3) free coiling of axes, and (4) persisting anchorage after senescence.",TRUE
A poisonous surprise under the coat of the African crested rat,"Plant toxins are sequestered by many animals and the toxicity is frequently advertised by aposematic displays to deter potential predators. Such ‚Äòunpalatability by appropriation‚Äô is common in many invertebrate groups and also found in a few vertebrate groups. However, potentially lethal toxicity by acquisition has so far never been reported for a placental mammal. Here, we describe complex morphological structures and behaviours whereby the African crested rat, Lophiomys imhausi, acquires, dispenses and advertises deterrent toxin. Roots and bark of Acokanthera schimperi (Apocynaceae) trees are gnawed, masticated and slavered onto highly specialized hairs that wick up the compound, to be delivered whenever the animal is bitten or mouthed by a predator. The poison is a cardenolide, closely resembling ouabain, one of the active components in a traditional African arrow poison long celebrated for its power to kill elephants.",TRUE
A Predator from East Africa that Chooses Malaria Vectors as Preferred Prey,"Background All vectors of human malaria, a disease responsible for more than one million deaths per year, are female mosquitoes from the genus Anopheles. Evarcha culicivora is an East African jumping spider (Salticidae) that feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by selecting blood-carrying female mosquitoes as preferred prey. Methodology/Principal Findings By testing with motionless lures made from mounting dead insects in lifelike posture on cork discs, we show that E. culicivora selects Anopheles mosquitoes in preference to other mosquitoes and that this predator can identify Anopheles by static appearance alone. Tests using active (grooming) virtual mosquitoes rendered in 3-D animation show that Anopheles' characteristic resting posture is an important prey-choice cue for E. culicivora. Expression of the spider's preference for Anopheles varies with the spider's size, varies with its prior feeding condition and is independent of the spider gaining a blood meal. Conclusions/Significance This is the first experimental study to show that a predator of any type actively chooses Anopheles as preferred prey, suggesting that specialized predators having a role in the biological control of disease vectors is a realistic possibility.",TRUE
A Role for Parasites in Stabilising the Fig-Pollinator Mutualism,"Mutualisms are interspecific interactions in which both players benefit. Explaining their maintenance is problematic, because cheaters should outcompete cooperative conspecifics, leading to mutualism instability. Monoecious figs (Ficus) are pollinated by host-specific wasps (Agaonidae), whose larvae gall ovules in their ‚Äúfruits‚Äù (syconia). Female pollinating wasps oviposit directly into Ficus ovules from inside the receptive syconium. Across Ficus species, there is a widely documented segregation of pollinator galls in inner ovules and seeds in outer ovules. This pattern suggests that wasps avoid, or are prevented from ovipositing into, outer ovules, and this results in mutualism stability. However, the mechanisms preventing wasps from exploiting outer ovules remain unknown. We report that in Ficus rubiginosa, offspring in outer ovules are vulnerable to attack by parasitic wasps that oviposit from outside the syconium. Parasitism risk decreases towards the centre of the syconium, where inner ovules provide enemy-free space for pollinator offspring. We suggest that the resulting gradient in offspring viability is likely to contribute to selection on pollinators to avoid outer ovules, and by forcing wasps to focus on a subset of ovules, reduces their galling rates. This previously unidentified mechanism may therefore contribute to mutualism persistence independent of additional factors that invoke plant defences against pollinator oviposition, or physiological constraints on pollinators that prevent oviposition in all available ovules.",TRUE

A single touch can provide sufficient mechanical stimulation to trigger Venus flytrap closure,"The carnivorous Venus flytrap catches prey by an ingenious snapping mechanism. Based on work over nearly 200 years, it has become generally accepted that two touches of the trap‚Äôs sensory hairs within 30 s, each one generating an action potential, are required to trigger closure of the trap. We developed an electromechanical model, which, however, suggests that under certain circumstances one touch is sufficient to generate two action potentials. Using a force-sensing microrobotic system, we precisely quantified the sensory-hair deflection parameters necessary to trigger trap closure and correlated them with the elicited action potentials in vivo. Our results confirm the model‚Äôs predictions, suggesting that the Venus flytrap may be adapted to a wider range of prey movements than previously assumed.",TRUE
A small proportion of Talin molecules transmit forces at developing muscle attachments in vivo,"Cells in developing organisms are subjected to particular mechanical forces that shape tissues and instruct cell fate decisions. How these forces are sensed and transmitted at the molecular level is therefore an important question, one that has mainly been investigated in cultured cells in vitro. Here, we elucidate how mechanical forces are transmitted in an intact organism. We studied Drosophila muscle attachment sites, which experience high mechanical forces during development and require integrin-mediated adhesion for stable attachment to tendons. Therefore, we quantified molecular forces across the essential integrin-binding protein Talin, which links integrin to the actin cytoskeleton. Generating flies expressing 3 F√∂rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Talin tension sensors reporting different force levels between 1 and 11 piconewton (pN) enabled us to quantify physiologically relevant molecular forces. By measuring primary Drosophila muscle cells, we demonstrate that Drosophila Talin experiences mechanical forces in cell culture that are similar to those previously reported for Talin in mammalian cell lines. However, in vivo force measurements at developing flight muscle attachment sites revealed that average forces across Talin are comparatively low and decrease even further while attachments mature and tissue-level tension remains high. Concomitantly, the Talin concentration at attachment sites increases 5-fold as quantified by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), suggesting that only a small proportion of Talin molecules are mechanically engaged at any given time. Reducing Talin levels at late stages of muscle development results in muscle‚Äìtendon rupture in the adult fly, likely as a result of active muscle contractions. We therefore propose that a large pool of adhesion molecules is required to share high tissue forces. As a result, less than 15% of the molecules experience detectable forces at developing muscle attachment sites at the same time. Our findings define an important new concept of how cells can adapt to changes in tissue mechanics to prevent mechanical failure in vivo.",TRUE
"A specialized avian seed dispersal system in a dry-fruited non-photosynthetic plant, Balanophora yakushimensis.","The family Balanophoraceae are among the most unusual of plants because they have aberrant vegetative bodies, highly reduced flowers, and small and reduced embryos (Hansen 1972, Gonzalez et al. 2019). Because the plants lack chlorophyll and are incapable of photosynthesis, they draw nutrition from other organisms. Indeed, like the well-known parasitic plant, Rafflesia, members of the Balanophoraceae acquire both water and nutrients from host plants. They are, therefore, highly specialized root parasites.",TRUE
A spider that feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by choosing female mosquitoes as prey.,"Spiders do not feed directly on vertebrate blood, but a small East African jumping spider (Salticidae), Evarcha culicivora, feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by choosing as preferred prey female mosquitoes that have had recent blood meals. Experiments show that this spider can identify its preferred prey by sight alone and by odor alone. When presented with two types of size-matched motionless lures, E. culicivora consistently chose blood-fed female mosquitoes in preference to nonmosquito prey, male mosquitoes, and sugar-fed female mosquitoes (i.e., females that had not been feeding on blood). When the choice was between mosquitoes of different sizes (both blood- or both sugar-fed), small juveniles chose the smaller prey, whereas adults and larger juveniles chose the larger prey. However, preference for blood took precedence over preference for size (i.e., to get a blood meal, small individuals took prey that were larger than the preferred size, and larger individuals took prey that were smaller than the preferred size). When presented with odor from two prey types, E. culicivora approached the odor from blood-fed female mosquitoes significantly more often the odor of the prey that were not carrying blood.",TRUE
"A sticky situation: solifugids (Arachnida, Solifugae) use adhesive organs on their pedipalps for prey capture","Solifugids (Arachnida, Solifugae) have unique evertable adhesive organs on the tips of their pedipalps, named ‚Äòsuctorial‚Äô or ‚Äòpalpal‚Äô organs. Previous studies have shown that these organs enable solifugids to climb smooth glass-like surfaces and have hypothesized that these structures facilitate prey capture. Here, we use high-speed videography to demonstrate that the suctorial organs of Eremochelis bilobatus are its primary means of capturing insect prey. We also present calculations of the adhesive pressure exerted by these suctorial organs during real prey capture events.",TRUE
A study of mucus from the solitary coral Fungia fungites (Scleractinia: Fungiidae) in relation to photobiological UV adaptation,"The ultraviolet (UV)-absorbance spectrum (300 to 360 nm) of mucus obtained from Fungia fungites (L. 1758, collected in Tahiti in 1991) after being exposed to air for up to 5 min was measured, and UV-absorbing compounds were demonstrated to be present in the mucus, with a peak at 332 nm. The concentration of these UV-absorbing compounds was at a maximum in the first 2 min of secretion and decreased thereafter. Concentration was significantly related to the weight of the coral. Also, as corals were adapted to bathymetric levels of UV radiation, mucus concentration of UV-absorbing compounds decreased significantly with increasing depth.",TRUE
A symbiotic bacterium of shipworms produces a compound with broad spectrum anti-apicomplexan activity,"Apicomplexan parasites cause severe disease in both humans and their domesticated animals. Since these parasites readily develop drug resistance, development of new, effective drugs to treat infection caused by these parasites is an ongoing challenge for the medical and veterinary communities. We hypothesized that invertebrate-bacterial symbioses might be a rich source of anti-apicomplexan compounds because invertebrates are susceptible to infections with gregarines, parasites that are ancestral to all apicomplexans. We chose to explore the therapeutic potential of shipworm symbiotic bacteria as they are bona fide symbionts, are easily grown in axenic culture and have genomes rich in secondary metabolite loci [1,2]. Two strains of the shipworm symbiotic bacterium, Teredinibacter turnerae, were screened for activity against Toxoplasma gondii and one strain, T7901, exhibited activity against intracellular stages of the parasite. Bioassay-guided fractionation identified tartrolon E (trtE) as the source of the activity. TrtE has an EC50 of 3 nM against T. gondii, acts directly on the parasite itself and kills the parasites after two hours of treatment. TrtE exhibits nanomolar to picomolar level activity against Cryptosporidium, Plasmodium, Babesia, Theileria, and Sarcocystis; parasites representing all branches of the apicomplexan phylogenetic tree. The compound also proved effective against Cryptosporidium parvum infection in neonatal mice, indicating that trtE may be a potential lead compound for preclinical development. Identification of a promising new compound after such limited screening strongly encourages further mining of invertebrate symbionts for new anti-parasitic therapeutics.",TRUE
A test of whether economy or nutrition determines fecal sac ingestion in nesting corvids,"Parent birds of many species eat the fecal sacs produced by their nestlings. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain why the parents ingest, rather than simply remove the sacs. (1) The parental nutrition hypothesis proposes that the parent benefits energetically or nutritionally from ingesting the sacs (Morton 1979, Gluck 1988); and (2) the economic disposal hypothesis postulates that parents incur some costs from eating waste products, but the cost of eating them is less than the benefits gained from being allowed to remain at the nest (Hurd et al. 1991). Behavioral data on nesting Florida Scrub Jays (Aphelocoma c. coerulescens) and American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) support the parental nutrition, and not the economic disposal hypothesis. In both species, when two parents were present at the production of fecal sacs, the most nutritionally stressed parent, the female, ate significantly more sacs than her mate. On occasions where one adult left the nest immediately after fecal sac production and one remained, the departing adult was not more likely to dispose of the sac in either species. In neither species was a departing adult more likely to carry of a fecal sac than eat it",TRUE
"A Unique Resource Mutualism between the Giant Bornean Pitcher Plant, Nepenthes rajah, and Members of a Small Mammal Community","The carnivorous pitcher plant genus Nepenthes grows in nutrient-deficient substrates and produce jug-shaped leaf organs (pitchers) that trap arthropods as a source of N and P. A number of Bornean Nepenthes demonstrate novel nutrient acquisition strategies. Notably, three giant montane species are engaged in a mutualistic association with the mountain treeshrew, Tupaia montana, in which the treeshrew defecates into the pitchers while visiting them to feed on nectar secretions on the pitchers' lids. Although the basis of this resource mutualism has been elucidated, many aspects are yet to be investigated. We sought to provide insights into the value of the mutualism to each participant. During initial observations we discovered that the summit rat, R. baluensis, also feeds on sugary exudates of N. rajah pitchers and defecates into them, and that this behavior appears to be habitual. The scope of the study was therefore expanded to assess to what degree N. rajah interacts with the small mammal community. We found that both T. montana and R. baluensis are engaged in a mutualistic interaction with N. rajah. T .montana visit pitchers more frequently than R. baluensis, but daily scat deposition rates within pitchers do not differ, suggesting that the mutualistic relationships are of a similar strength. This study is the first to demonstrate that a mutualism exists between a carnivorous plant species and multiple members of a small mammal community. Further, the newly discovered mutualism between R. baluensis and N. rajah represents only the second ever example of a multidirectional resource-based mutualism between a mammal and a carnivorous plant.",TRUE
A Visual Pathway Links Brain Structures Active during Magnetic Compass Orientation in Migratory Birds,"The magnetic compass of migratory birds has been suggested to be light-dependent. Retinal cryptochrome-expressing neurons and a forebrain region, ‚ÄúCluster N‚Äù, show high neuronal activity when night-migratory songbirds perform magnetic compass orientation. By combining neuronal tracing with behavioral experiments leading to sensory-driven gene expression of the neuronal activity marker ZENK during magnetic compass orientation, we demonstrate a functional neuronal connection between the retinal neurons and Cluster N via the visual thalamus. Thus, the two areas of the central nervous system being most active during magnetic compass orientation are part of an ascending visual processing stream, the thalamofugal pathway. Furthermore, Cluster N seems to be a specialized part of the visual wulst. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that migratory birds use their visual system to perceive the reference compass direction of the geomagnetic field and that migratory birds ‚Äúsee‚Äù the reference compass direction provided by the geomagnetic field.",TRUE
A water-borne adhesive modeled after the sandcastle glue of P. californica.,"Polyacrylate glue protein analogs of the glue secreted by Phragmatopoma californica, a marine polycheate, were synthesized with phosphate, primary amine, and catechol sidechains with molar ratios similar to the natural glue proteins. Aqueous mixtures of the mimetic polyelectrolytes condensed into liquid complex coacervates around neutral pH. Wet cortical bone specimens bonded with the coacervates, oxidatively crosslinked through catechol sidechains, had bond strengths nearly 40% of the strength of a commercial cyanoacrylate. The unique material properties of complex coacervates may be ideal for development of clinically useful adhesives and other biomaterials.",TRUE
Absence of eye shine and tapetum in the heterogeneous eye of Anthocharis butterflies (Pieridae),"SUMMARY Insect eyes are composed of spectrally heterogeneous ommatidia, typically with three different types. The ommatidial heterogeneity in butterflies can be identified non-invasively by the colorful eye shine, the reflection from the tapetal mirror located at the proximal end of the ommatidia, which can be observed by epi-illumination microscopy. Since the color of eye shine is determined by the spectral properties of the ommatidia, it has been tentatively related to color vision. In the course of a survey of ommatidial heterogeneity in butterflies, we found that members of the pierid genus Anthocharis lack the eye shine. We therefore carried out anatomy of the eye of the yellow tip, Anthocharis scolymus, and correlated it with the absence of the tapetum. The butterfly tapetum is a remnant of the ancestral moth tapetum, a trait that has been completely lost in the papilionids and also, as now appears, in the genus Anthocharis. Anatomical investigations also revealed that, considering rhabdom shape, peri-rhabdomal pigment clusters and autofluorescence, the ommatidia can be divided in at least two different types, which are randomly distributed in the retina.",TRUE
Accumulation of ammonia in the body and NH3 volatilization from alkaline regions of the body surface during ammonia loading and exposure to air in the weather loach Misgurnus anguillicaudatus,"The weather loach Misgurnus anguillicaudatus inhabits rice fields that experience drought in summer and ammonia loading during agricultural fertilisation. Exposure of specimens to ammonia led to the accumulation of ammonia in muscle, liver and blood. The level of ammonia reached in the plasma was the highest reported among fishes. Ammonia was not detoxified to urea, and urea excretion rate was unaffected by ammonia exposure. Fish acidified the water to reduce ammonia loading. Ammonia loading, unlike aerial exposure, did not induce glutamine synthesis, and there was no accumulation of glutamine. This is a unique observation different from those reported for other fishes in the literature. An initial switch to partial amino acid catabolism led to the accumulation of alanine and was probably associated with a decreased rate of ammonia production. Aerial exposure led to decreases in rates of ammonia and urea excretion, as well as the accumulation of tissue ammonia. As the internal ammonia levels increased, M. anguillicaudatus was able to excrete some ammonia in the gaseous form (NH3). The percentage of ammonia excreted as NH3 increased with time of exposure and with increasing temperature. It appears that air-breathing through the gut is involved, with the anterior portion of the digestive tract playing a central role: it became significantly more alkaline in fish exposed to air or to environmental ammonia. The skin, which also became more alkaline during air exposure, may also be involved in ammonia volatilization in air-exposed fish. This represents the first report of a fish using volatilization of NH3 as part of a defence against ammonia toxicity. It can be concluded that the main strategy adopted by M. anguillicaudatus confronted with ammonia loading or air exposure is to tolerate high ammonia levels in the tissues. During periods of elevated tissue ammonia levels, some ammonia is lost by volatilization via air-breathing using the gut. In addition, some ammonia may be lost across the skin during air exposure.",TRUE

"Active electrolocation in Gnathonemus petersii: Behaviour, sensory performance, and receptor systems","Weakly electric fish can serve as model systems for active sensing because they actively emit electric signals into the environment, which they also perceive with more than 2000 electroreceptor organs (mormyromasts) distributed over almost their entire skin surface. In a process called active electrolocation, animals are able to detect and analyse objects in their environment, which allows them to perceive a detailed electrical picture of their surroundings even in complete darkness. The African mormyrid fish Gnathonemus petersii can not only detect nearby objects, but in addition can perceive other properties such as their distance, their complex electrical impedance, and their three-dimensional shape. Because most of the sensory signals the fish perceive during their nightly activity period are self-produced, evolution has shaped and adapted the mechanisms for signal production, signal perception and signal analysis by the brain. Like in many other sensory systems, so-called prereceptor mechanisms exist, which passively improve the sensory signals in such a way that the signal carrier is optimized for the extraction of relevant sensory information. In G. petersii prereceptor mechanisms include properties of the animal's skin and internal tissue and the shape of the fish's body. These lead to a specific design of the signal carrier at different skin regions of the fish, preparing them to perform certain detection tasks. Prereceptor mechanisms also ensure that the moveable skin appendix of G. petersii, the 'Schnauzenorgan', receives an optimal sensory signal during all stages of its movement. Another important aspect of active sensing in G. petersii concerns the locomotor strategies during electrolocation. When foraging, the animals adopt a particular position with the body slanted forward bringing the so-called 'nasal region' in a position to examine the environment in front of and at the side of the fish. Simultaneously, the Schnauzenorgan performs rhythmic left-right searching movements. When an object of interest is encountered, the Schnauzenorgan is brought in a twitching movement towards the object and is moved over it for further exploration. The densities of electroreceptor organs is extraordinary high at the Schnauzenorgan and, to a lesser extend, at the nasal region. In these so-called foveal regions, the mormyromasts have a different morphology compared to other parts of the electroreceptive skin. Our results on mormyromast density and morphology, prereceptor mechanisms and electric images, central processing of electroreceptive information, and on behavioural strategies of G. petersii lead us to formulate the hypothesis that these fish possess two separate electric foveae, each of which is specialized for certain perceptional tasks.",TRUE
Active-site properties of Phrixotrix railroad worm green and red bioluminescence-eliciting luciferases,"The luciferases of the railroad worm Phrixotrix (Coleoptera: Phengodidae) are the only beetle luciferases that naturally produce true red bioluminescence. Previously, we cloned the green- (PxGR) and red-emitting (PxRE) luciferases of railroad worms Phrixotrix viviani and P. hirtus[OLE1]. These luciferases were expressed and purified, and their active-site properties were determined. The red-emitting PxRE luciferase displays flash-like kinetics, whereas PxGR luciferase displays slow-type kinetics. The substrate affinities and catalytic efficiency of PxRE luciferase are also higher than those of PxGR luciferase. Fluorescence studies with 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid and 6-p-toluidino-2-naphthalene sulfonic acid showed that the PxRE luciferase luciferin-binding site is more polar than that of PxGR luciferase, and it is sensitive to guanidine. Mutagenesis and modelling studies suggest that several invariant residues in the putative luciferin-binding site of PxRE luciferase cannot interact with excited oxyluciferin. These results suggest that one portion of the luciferin-binding site of the red-emitting luciferase is tighter than that of PxGR luciferase, whereas the other portion could be more open and polar.",TRUE
Actuation systems in plants as prototypes for bioinspired devices,Plants have evolved a multitude of mechanisms to actuate organ movement. The osmotic influx and efflux of water in living cells can cause a rapid movement of organs in a predetermined direction. Even dead tissue can be actuated by a swelling or drying of the plant cell walls. The deformation of the organ is controlled at different levels of tissue hierarchy by geometrical constraints at the micrometre level (e.g. cell shape and size) and cell wall polymer composition at the nanoscale (e.g. cellulose fibril orientation). This paper reviews different mechanisms of organ movement in plants and highlights recent research in the field. Particular attention is paid to systems that are activated without any metabolism. The design principles of such systems may be particularly useful for a biomimetic translation into active technical composites and moving devices.,TRUE
Adaptable Defense: A Nudibranch Mucus Inhibits Nematocyst Discharge and Changes With Prey Type,"Nudibranchs that feed on cnidarians must defend themselves from the prey‚Äôs nematocysts or risk their own injury or death. While a nudibranch‚Äôs mucus has been thought to protect the animal from nematocyst discharge, an inhibition of discharge by nudibranch mucus has never been shown. The current study investigated whether mucus from the aeolid nudibranch Aeolidia papillosa would inhibit nematocyst discharge from four species of sea anemone prey. Sea anemone tentacles were contacted with mucus-coated gelatin probes, and nematocyst discharge was quantified and compared with control probes of gelatin only. Mucus from A. papillosa inhibited the discharge of nematocysts from sea anemone tentacles. This inhibition was specifically limited to the anemone species on which the nudibranch had been feeding. When the prey species was changed, the mucus changed within 2 weeks to inhibit the nematocyst discharge of the new prey species. The nudibranchs apparently produce the inhibitory mucus rather than simply becoming coated in anemone mucus during feeding. Because of the intimate association between most aeolid nudibranchs and their prey, an adaptable mucus protection could have a significant impact on the behavior, distribution, and life history of the nudibranchs.",TRUE
"Adaptation to life in aeolian sand: how the sandfish lizard, Scincus scincus, prevents sand particles from entering its lungs","ABSTRACT The sandfish lizard, Scincus scincus (Squamata: Scincidae), spends nearly its whole life in aeolian sand and only comes to the surface for foraging, defecating and mating. It is not yet understood how the animal can respire without sand particles entering its respiratory organs when buried under thick layers of sand. In this work, we integrated biological studies, computational calculations and physical experiments to understand this phenomenon. We present a 3D model of the upper respiratory system based on a detailed histological analysis. A 3D-printed version of this model was used in combination with characteristic ventilation patterns for computational calculations and fluid mechanics experiments. By calculating the velocity field, we identified a sharp decrease in velocity in the anterior part of the nasal cavity where mucus and cilia are present. The experiments with the 3D-printed model validate the calculations: particles, if present, were found only in the same area as suggested by the calculations. We postulate that the sandfish has an aerodynamic filtering system; more specifically, that the characteristic morphology of the respiratory channel coupled with specific ventilation patterns prevent particles from entering the lungs. Highlighted Article: The sandfish S. scincus spends nearly its whole life in fine desert sand. We discovered that it has an aerodynamic filtering system to prevent sand particles from entering the lungs.",TRUE
Adaptations to in situ feeding: novel nutrient acquisition pathways in an ancient vertebrate,"During feeding, hagfish may immerse themselves in the body cavities of decaying carcasses, encountering high levels of dissolved organic nutrients. We hypothesized that this feeding environment might promote nutrient acquisition by the branchial and epidermal epithelia. The potential for Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, to absorb amino acids from the environment across the skin and gill was thus investigated. l-alanine and glycine were absorbed via specific transport pathways across both gill and skin surfaces, the first such documentation of direct organic nutrient acquisition in a vertebrate animal. Uptake occurred via distinct mechanisms with respect to concentration dependence, sodium dependence and effects of putative transport inhibitors across each epithelium. Significant differences in the absorbed amino acid distribution between the skin of juveniles and adults were noted. The ability to absorb dissolved organic matter across the skin and gill may be an adaptation to a scavenging lifestyle, allowing hagfish to maximize sporadic opportunities for organic nutrient acquisition. From an evolutionary perspective, hagfish represent a transitory state between the generalized nutrient absorption pathways of aquatic invertebrates and the more specialized digestive systems of aquatic vertebrates.",TRUE
Adaptive Advantages of Cooperative Courtship for Subordinate Male Lance‚ÄêTailed Manakins,"Male lance‚Äêtailed manakins (Chiroxiphia lanceolata) cooperate in complex courtship displays, but the dominant (alpha) partner monopolizes mating opportunities. This raises the question of why subordinates (betas) cooperate. Three nonexclusive hypotheses explain the adaptive basis of helping behavior by subordinate males: cooperation may increase (1) subordinates‚Äô immediate reproductive success, (2) the reproductive success of close relatives, or (3) subordinates‚Äô chances of future reproduction. I demonstrated that beta males rarely sired chicks and were unrelated to their alpha partners but received delayed direct benefits from cooperation; betas had an increased probability of becoming an alpha when compared to males that had not been betas. To investigate the mechanism by which betas attain these adaptive benefits, I examined betas‚Äô success in replacing their alpha partners both in natural turnover events and when alphas were experimentally removed. Beta males did not consistently inherit alpha roles in the same territories where they served their beta tenure, arguing that queuing for status does not fully explain the benefits of cooperation for betas. Instead, betas may be apprenticing to develop effective and appropriate displays that enhance their subsequent success as alphas. Complex social affiliations appear to mediate selective pressure for cooperation in this species.",TRUE
Adaptive evolution of threonine deaminase in plant defense against insect herbivores,"Gene duplication is a major source of plant chemical diversity that mediates plant‚Äìherbivore interactions. There is little direct evidence, however, that novel chemical traits arising from gene duplication reduce herbivory. Higher plants use threonine deaminase (TD) to catalyze the dehydration of threonine (Thr) to Œ±-ketobutyrate and ammonia as the committed step in the biosynthesis of isoleucine (Ile). Cultivated tomato and related Solanum species contain a duplicated TD paralog (TD2) that is coexpressed with a suite of genes involved in herbivore resistance. Analysis of TD2-deficient tomato lines showed that TD2 has a defensive function related to Thr catabolism in the gut of lepidopteran herbivores. During herbivory, the regulatory domain of TD2 is removed by proteolysis to generate a truncated protein (pTD2) that efficiently degrades Thr without being inhibited by Ile. We show that this proteolytic activation step occurs in the gut of lepidopteran but not coleopteran herbivores, and is catalyzed by a chymotrypsin-like protease of insect origin. Analysis of purified recombinant enzymes showed that TD2 is remarkably more resistant to proteolysis and high temperature than the ancestral TD1 isoform. The crystal structure of pTD2 provided evidence that electrostatic interactions constitute a stabilizing feature associated with adaptation of TD2 to the extreme environment of the lepidopteran gut. These findings demonstrate a role for gene duplication in the evolution of a plant defense that targets and co-opts herbivore digestive physiology.",TRUE
Adhesion forces measured at the level of a terminal plate of the fly's seta,"The attachment pads of fly legs are covered with setae, each ending in small terminal plates coated with secretory fluid. A cluster of these terminal plates contacting a substrate surface generates strong attractive forces that hold the insect on smooth surfaces. Previous research assumed that cohesive forces and molecular adhesion were involved in the fly attachment mechanism. The main elements that contribute to the overall attachment force, however, remained unknown. Multiple local force‚Äìvolume measurements were performed on individual terminal plates by using atomic force microscopy. It was shown that the geometry of a single terminal plate had a higher border and considerably lower centre. Local adhesion was approximately twice as strong in the centre of the plate as on its border. Adhesion of fly footprints on a glass surface, recorded within 20 min after preparation, was similar to adhesion in the centre of a single attachment pad. Adhesion strongly decreased with decreasing volume of footprint fluid, indicating that the layer of pad secretion covering the terminal plates is crucial for the generation of a strong attractive force. Our data provide the first direct evidence that, in addition to Van der Waals and Coulomb forces, attractive capillary forces, mediated by pad secretion, are a critical factor in the fly's attachment mechanism.",TRUE
Adhesion of single bacterial cells in the micronewton range.,"The adhesion of bacteria to surfaces plays critical roles in the environment, disease, and industry. In aquatic environments, Caulobacter crescentus is one of the first colonizers of submerged surfaces. Using a micromanipulation technique, we measured the adhesion force of single C. crescentus cells attached to borosilicate substrates through their adhesive holdfast. The detachment forces measured for 14 cells ranged over 0.11 to 2.26 microN, averaging 0.59 +/- 0.62 microN. Based on the calculation of stress distribution with the finite element analysis method (dividing an object into small grids and calculating relevant parameters for all of the elements), the adhesion strength between the holdfast and the substrate is >68 N/mm(2) in the central region of contact. To our knowledge, this strength of adhesion is the strongest ever measured for biological adhesives.",TRUE
Adhesive recruitment by the viscous capture threads of araneoid orb-weaving spiders,"SUMMARY The sticky prey capture threads of orb-webs are critical to web performance. By retaining insects that strike the web, these spirally arrayed threads allow a spider time to locate and subdue prey. The viscous capture threads spun by modern orb-weaving spiders of the Araneoidea clade replaced the dry, fuzzy cribellar capture threads of the Deinopoidea and feature regularly spaced moist, adhesive droplets. The stickiness of a cribellar thread is limited by its tendency to peel from a surface after the adhesion generated at the edges of contact is exceeded. In this study we test the hypothesis that viscous thread overcomes this limitation by implementing a suspension bridge mechanism (SBM) that recruits the adhesion of multiple thread droplets. We do so by using contact plates of four widths to measure the stickiness of six species' viscous threads whose profiles range from small, closely spaced droplets to large, widely spaced droplets. The increased stickiness registered by an increased number of thread droplets supports the operation of a SBM. However, the accompanying decrease in mean per droplet adhesion shows that droplets interior to the edges of thread contact contribute successively less adhesion. Models developed from these data suggest that the suspension bridge mechanism is limited to a span of approximately 12 droplets.",TRUE
Aerial roots of epiphytic orchids: the velamen radicum and its role in water and nutrient uptake,"The velamen radicum, a spongy, usually multiple epidermis of the roots, which at maturity consists of dead cells, is frequently described as an important adaptation of epiphytic orchids. Yet, quantitative evidence for the alleged functions, e.g., efficient water and nutrient uptake, nutrient retention, reduction of water loss, mechanical protection, or the avoidance of overheating, is rare or missing. We tested the notion originally put forward by Went in 1940 that the velamen allows plants to capture and immobilize the first solutions arriving in a rainfall, which are the most heavily charged with nutrients. In a series of experiments, we examined whether all necessary functional characteristics are given for this scenario to be realistic under ecological conditions. First, we show that the velamen of a large number of orchid species takes up solutions within seconds, while evaporation from the velamen takes several hours. Charged ions are retained in the velamen probably due to positive and negative charges in the cell walls, while uncharged compounds are lost to the external medium. Finally, we demonstrate that nutrient uptake follows biphasic kinetics with a highly efficient, active transport system at low external concentrations. Thus, our results lend strong support to Went‚Äôs hypothesis: the velamen fulfills an important function in nutrient uptake in the epiphytic habitat. Most of the other functions outlined above still await similar experimental scrutiny.",TRUE
"Aerodynamic force generation, performance and control of body orientation during gliding in sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps)","SUMMARY Gliding has often been discussed in the literature as a possible precursor to powered flight in vertebrates, but few studies exist on the mechanics of gliding in living animals. In this study I analyzed the 3D kinematics of sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps) during short glides in an enclosed space. Short segments of the glide were captured on video, and the positions of marked anatomical landmarks were used to compute linear distances and angles, as well as whole body velocities and accelerations. From the whole body accelerations I estimated the aerodynamic forces generated by the animals. I computed the correlations between movements of the limbs and body rotations to examine the control of orientation during flight. Finally, I compared these results to those of my earlier study on the similarly sized and distantly related southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans). The sugar gliders in this study accelerated downward slightly (1.0¬±0.5 m s‚Äì2), and also accelerated forward (2.1¬±0.6 m s‚Äì2) in all but one trial, indicating that the body weight was not fully supported by aerodynamic forces and that some of the lift produced forward acceleration rather than just balancing body weight. The gliders used high angles of attack (44.15¬±3.12¬∞), far higher than the angles at which airplane wings would stall, yet generated higher lift coefficients (1.48¬±0.18) than would be expected for a stalled wing. Movements of the limbs were strongly correlated with body rotations, suggesting that sugar gliders make extensive use of limb movements to control their orientation during gliding flight. In addition, among individuals, different limb movements were associated with a given body rotation, suggesting that individual variation exists in the control of body rotations. Under similar conditions, flying squirrels generated higher lift coefficients and lower drag coefficients than sugar gliders, yet had only marginally shallower glides. Flying squirrels have a number of morphological specializations not shared by sugar gliders that may help to explain their greater lift generating performance.",TRUE

Aerodynamics of saccate pollen and its implications for wind pollination,"Pollen grains of many wind-pollinated plants contain 1-3 air-filled bladders, or sacci. Sacci are thought to help orient the pollen grain in the pollination droplet. Sacci also increase surface area of the pollen grain, yet add minimal mass, thereby increasing dispersal distance; however, this aerodynamic hypothesis has not been tested in a published study. Using scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, mathematical modeling, and the saccate pollen of three extant conifers with structurally different pollen grains (Pinus, Falcatifolium, Dacrydium), we developed a computational model to investigate pollen flight. The model calculates terminal settling velocity based on structural characters of the pollen grain, including lengths, widths, and depths of the main body and sacci; angle of saccus rotation; and thicknesses of the saccus wall, endoreticulations, intine, and exine. The settling speeds predicted by the model were empirically validated by stroboscopic photography. This study is the first to quantitatively demonstrate the adaptive significance of sacci for the aerodynamics of wind pollination. Modeling pollen both with and without sacci indicated that sacci can reduce pollen settling speeds, thereby increasing dispersal distance, with the exception of pollen grains having robust endoreticulations and those with thick saccus walls. Furthermore, because the mathematical model is based on structural characters and error propagation methods show that the model yields valid results when sample sizes are small, the flight dynamics of fossil pollen can be investigated. Several fossils were studied, including bisaccate (Pinus, Pteruchus, Caytonanthus), monosaccate (Gothania), and nonsaccate (Monoletes) pollen types.",TRUE
Aerodynamics of the hovering hummingbird,"Despite profound musculoskeletal differences, hummingbirds (Trochilidae) are widely thought to employ aerodynamic mechanisms similar to those used by insects. The kinematic symmetry of the hummingbird upstroke and downstroke has led to the assumption that these halves of the wingbeat cycle contribute equally to weight support during hovering, as exhibited by insects of similar size. This assumption has been applied, either explicitly or implicitly, in widely used aerodynamic models and in a variety of empirical tests. Here we provide measurements of the wake of hovering rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) obtained with digital particle image velocimetry that show force asymmetry: hummingbirds produce 75% of their weight support during the downstroke and only 25% during the upstroke. Some of this asymmetry is probably due to inversion of their cambered wings during upstroke. The wake of hummingbird wings also reveals evidence of leading-edge vortices created during the downstroke, indicating that they may operate at Reynolds numbers sufficiently low to exploit a key mechanism typical of insect hovering. Hummingbird hovering approaches that of insects, yet remains distinct because of effects resulting from an inherently dissimilar‚Äîavian‚Äîbody plan.",TRUE

Alcids ‚Äòfly‚Äô at efficient Strouhal numbers in both air and water but vary stroke velocity and angle,"Birds that use their wings for ‚Äòflight‚Äô in both air and water are expected to fly poorly in each fluid relative to single-fluid specialists; that is, these jacks-of-all-trades should be the masters of none. Alcids exhibit exceptional dive performance while retaining aerial flight. We hypothesized that alcids maintain efficient Strouhal numbers and stroke velocities across air and water, allowing them to mitigate the costs of their ‚Äòfluid generalism‚Äô. We show that alcids cruise at Strouhal numbers between 0.10 and 0.40 ‚Äì on par with single-fluid specialists ‚Äì in both air and water but flap their wings ~ 50% slower in water. Thus, these species either contract their muscles at inefficient velocities or maintain a two-geared muscle system, highlighting a clear cost to using the same morphology for locomotion in two fluids. Additionally, alcids varied stroke-plane angle between air and water and chord angle during aquatic flight, expanding their performance envelope.",TRUE
Algal ice-binding proteins change the structure of sea ice,"Krembs et al. (1) reported that extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by a sea ice diatom, Melosira, created convoluted ice-pore morphologies in sea ice, potentially increasing its habitability and primary productivity. The activity was reduced by heat treatment and glycosidase treatments, suggesting that a glycoprotein was involved. Based on our previous work (2), it is very likely that the active substance is an ice-binding protein (IBP).",TRUE
Allometry of Alarm Calls: Black-Capped Chickadees Encode Information About Predator Size,"Many animals produce alarm signals when they detect a potential predator, but we still know little about the information contained in these signals. Using presentations of 15 species of live predators, we show that acoustic features of the mobbing calls of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapilla) vary with the size of the predator. Companion playback experiments revealed that chickadees detect this information and that the intensity of mobbing behavior is related to the size and threat of the potential predator. This study demonstrates an unsuspected level of complexity and sophistication in avian alarm calls.",TRUE
Alternation between attachment mechanisms by limpets in the field,"The attachment mechanism used by limpets in the rocky, wave-swept intertidal zone of California was determined during high tide and low tide. The two mechanisms that limpets are known to use, suction and glue-like adhesion, were distinguished by measuring the limpets' attachment forces in shear and by staining for glue-like residues where the limpets had been attached. The results show that ‚âà 73% of limpets at high tide use suction, while the rest use glue-like adhesion. Conversely, ‚âà 75% of limpets at low tide use glue-like adhesion, while the rest use suction. The normal tenacity of limpets was also measured at high and low tide. The mean tenacity at high tide was significantly less than that at low tide. From these data it was estimated that the mean tenacity of glue-like adhesion is ‚âà 0.23 MN¬∑m‚àí2 and the mean tenacity of suction adhesion is ‚âà 0.09 MN¬∑m‚àí2. It is hypothesized that the cycle of alternating attachment mechanisms is linked to the limpets foraging cycles.",TRUE
Always on the bright side of life: anti-adhesive properties of insect ommatidia grating,"SUMMARY The surface of some insect eyes consists of arrays of cuticular protuberances, which are 50‚Äì300 nm in diameter, and are termed corneal nipples or ommatidia gratings. They were widely reported to reduce the reflectance for normally incident light, contributing to camouflage by reducing glare to predators, while furthermore enhancing the intake of light, which is especially important for nocturnal insects. Our preliminary observations suggest a third function: in contrast to the rest of the body, ommatidia of various insects remain clean, even in a heavy contaminated environment. In order to prove such an anti-contamination hypothesis of these structures, we measured the adhesive properties of polymer moulds of insect ommatidia, and compared these data with control surfaces having the same curvature radii but lacking such a nanostructure. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) study and force measurements using an atomic force microscope (AFM) on the eye surfaces of three different insect species, dragonfly Aeshna mixta (Odonata), moth Laothoe populi (Lepidoptera) and fly Volucella pellucens (Diptera), were undertaken. We revealed that adhesion is greatly reduced by corneal grating in L. populi and V. pellucens when compared with their smooth controls. The smooth cornea of A. mixta showed no statistically significant difference to its control. We assume that this anti-adhesive phenomenon is due to a decrease in the real contact area between contaminating particles and the eye's surface. Such a combination of three functions in one nanostructure can be interesting for the development of industrial multifunctional surfaces capable of enhancing light harvesting while reducing light reflection and adhesion.",TRUE
"An Acidic Matrix Protein, Pif, Is a Key Macromolecule for Nacre Formation","Making Mother of Pearl Nacre is an iridescent layer of calcium carbonate lining the inside of shells of marine mollusks and is commonly known as ‚Äúmother of pearl.‚Äù It is composed of layers of uniformly oriented crystals of aragonite (a metastable form of calcium carbonate) separated by layers of organic matrix. How the ordered structure of aragonite layers is achieved has been unclear. Suzuki et al. (p. 1388, published online 13 August 2009; see the Perspective by Kr√∂ger) identified two acidic matrix proteins (Pif 97 and Pif 80) that regulate nacre formation in the Japanese pearl oyster. The proteins appear to form a complex in which Pif 80 binds to aragonite and Pif 97 binds to other macromolecules in the organic matrix. A matrix protein is identified that regulates nacre formation in the Japanese pearl oyster. The mollusk shell is a hard tissue consisting of calcium carbonate crystals and an organic matrix. The nacre of the shell is characterized by a stacked compartment structure with a uniformly oriented c axis of aragonite crystals in each compartment. Using a calcium carbonate‚Äìbinding assay, we identified an acidic matrix protein, Pif, in the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata that specifically binds to aragonite crystals. The Pif complementary DNA (cDNA) encoded a precursor protein, which was posttranslationally cleaved to produce Pif 97 and Pif 80. The results from immunolocalization, a knockdown experiment that used RNA interference, and in vitro calcium carbonate crystallization studies strongly indicate that Pif regulates nacre formation.",TRUE
An exceptionally fast actomyosin reaction powers insect flight muscle,"Insects, as a group, have been remarkably successful in adapting to a great range of physical and biological environments, in large part because of their ability to fly. The evolution of flight in small insects was accompanied by striking adaptations of the thoracic musculature that enabled very high wing beat frequencies. At the cellular and protein filament level, a stretch activation mechanism evolved that allowed high-oscillatory work to be achieved at very high frequencies as contraction and nerve stimulus became asynchronous. At the molecular level, critical adaptations occurred within the motor protein myosin II, because its elementary interactions with actin set the speed of sarcomere contraction. Here, we show that the key myosin enzymatic adaptations required for powering the very fast flight muscles in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster include the highest measured detachment rate of myosin from actin (forward rate constant, 3,698 s‚àí1), an exceptionally weak affinity of MgATP for myosin (association constant, 0.2 mM‚àí1), and a unique rate-limiting step in the cross-bridge cycle at the point of inorganic phosphate release. The latter adaptations are constraints imposed by the overriding requirement for exceptionally fast release of the hydrolytic product MgADP. Otherwise, as in Drosophila embryonic muscle and other slow muscle types, a step associated with MgADP release limits muscle contraction speed by delaying the detachment of myosin from actin.",TRUE
An excitable gene regulatory circuit induces transient cellular differentiation,"Certain types of cellular differentiation are probabilistic and transient. In such systems individual cells can switch to an alternative state and, after some time, switch back again. In Bacillus subtilis, competence is an example of such a transiently differentiated state associated with the capability for DNA uptake from the environment. Individual genes and proteins underlying differentiation into the competent state have been identified, but it has been unclear how these genes interact dynamically in individual cells to control both spontaneous entry into competence and return to vegetative growth. Here we show that this behaviour can be understood in terms of excitability in the underlying genetic circuit. Using quantitative fluorescence time-lapse microscopy, we directly observed the activities of multiple circuit components simultaneously in individual cells, and analysed the resulting data in terms of a mathematical model. We find that an excitable core module containing positive and negative feedback loops can explain both entry into, and exit from, the competent state. We further tested this model by analysing initiation in sister cells, and by re-engineering the gene circuit to specifically block exit. Excitable dynamics driven by noise naturally generate stochastic and transient responses, thereby providing an ideal mechanism for competence regulation.",TRUE
An experimental test of the contributions and condition dependence of microstructure and carotenoids in yellow plumage coloration,"A combination of structural and pigmentary components is responsible for many of the colour displays of animals. Despite the ubiquity of this type of coloration, neither the relative contribution of structures and pigments to variation in such colour displays nor the relative effects of extrinsic factors on the structural and pigment-based components of such colour has been determined. Understanding the sources of colour variation is important because structures and pigments may convey different information to conspecifics. In an experiment on captive American goldfinches Carduelis tristis, we manipulated two parameters, carotenoid availability and food availability, known to affect the expression of carotenoid pigments in a full-factorial design. Yellow feathers from these birds were then analysed in two ways. First, we used full-spectrum spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography to examine the extent to which variation in white structural colour and total carotenoid content was associated with variation in colour properties of feathers. The carotenoid content of yellow feathers predicted two colour parameters (principal component 1‚Äîrepresenting high values of ultraviolet and yellow chroma and low values of violet‚Äìblue chroma‚Äîand hue). Two different colour parameters (violet‚Äìblue and yellow chroma) from white de-pigmented feathers, as well as carotenoid content, predicted reflectance measurements from yellow feathers. Second, we determined the relative effects of our experimental manipulations on white structural colour and yellow colour. Carotenoid availability directly affected yellow colour, while food availability affected it only in combination with carotenoid availability. None of our manipulations had significant effects on the expression of white structural colour. Our results suggest that the contribution of microstructures to variation in the expression of yellow coloration is less than the contribution of carotenoid content, and that carotenoid deposition is more dependent on extrinsic variability than is the production of white structural colour.",TRUE
An insect trap as habitat: cohesion-failure mechanism prevents adhesion of Pameridea roridulae bugs to the sticky surface of the plant Roridula gorgonias,"SUMMARY The glandular trichomes of the plant Roridula gorgonias release an extremely adhesive, visco-elastic, resinous secretion that traps a variety of insects, including those having a considerable body size. However, the specialized mutualistic mirid bug Pameridea roridulae lives and walks on this sticky plant surface without being trapped. We have sought to reveal the mechanism underlying the apparent non-sticky nature of the cuticle of this bug. In this study, we have visualized intact plant and insect surfaces using cryo-scanning electron microscopy and measured the adhesive properties of the plant secretion on different surfaces. We present a combination of structural and experimental results that suggest that a thick and cohesively weak film of an outermost, epicuticular greasy secretion acts as a `sloughing-off' layer, preventing the formation of contacts between the sticky plant secretion and the solid insect cuticle. In a comparative study of fresh cuticle fractures of flies representing a typical prey of R. gorgonias, a thin, fragmentary layer of epicuticular grease was revealed. These results indicate that, when trapping prey, the plant adhesive might form proper contact with solid islands of the insect cuticle that are free of epicuticular grease.",TRUE
An Intertidal Sea Star Adjusts Thermal Inertia to Avoid Extreme Body Temperatures,"The body temperature of ectotherms is influenced by the interaction of abiotic conditions, morphology, and behavior. Although organisms living in different thermal habitats may exhibit morphological plasticity or move from unfavorable locations, there are few examples of animals adjusting their thermal properties in response to short‚Äêterm changes in local conditions. Here, we show that the intertidal sea star Pisaster ochraceus modulates its thermal inertia in response to prior thermal exposure. After exposure to high body temperature at low tide, sea stars increase the amount of colder‚Äêthan‚Äêair fluid in their coelomic cavity when submerged during high tide, resulting in a lower body temperature during the subsequent low tide. Moreover, this buffering capacity is more effective when seawater is cold during the previous high tide. This ability to modify the volume of coelomic fluid provides sea stars with a novel thermoregulatory ‚Äúbackup‚Äù when faced with prolonged exposure to elevated aerial temperatures.",TRUE
Analysis of an ultra hard magnetic biomineral in chiton radular teeth,"Recent analyses of the ultrastructural and mechanical properties of mineralized biological materials have demonstrated some common architectural features that can help explain their observed damage tolerance. Nature has accomplished this feat through the precise control of anisotropic crystal nucleation and growth processes in conjunction with nanoscale control over the self-assembly of spatially distinct organic and inorganic phases, resulting in effective inhibition of crack propagation through these materials. One such example is found in the hyper-mineralized and abrasion resistant radular teeth of the chitons, a group of herbivorous marine mollusks who have the surprising capacity to erode away the rocky substrates on which they graze 1-4 . Through the use of modern microscopy and nanomechanical characterization techniques, we describe the architectural and mechanical properties of the radular teeth from Cryptochiton stelleri. Chiton teeth are shown to exhibit the largest hardness and stiffness of any biominerals reported to date, being notably as much as three-fold harder than human enamel and the calcium carbonate-based shells of mollusks. We explain how the unique multi-phasic design of these materials contributes not only to their functionality, but also highlights some interesting design principles that might be applied to the fabrication of synthetic composites.",TRUE
Anatomical significance of the hygrochastic movement in Anastatica hierochuntica,"Background and aims:                    Unlike the dispersal mechanisms of many desert plants, the whole dead skeleton of Anastatica hierochuntica is involved in seed dispersal and preservation.

Anatomical significance of the hygrochastic movement in Anastatica hierochuntica.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMSUnlike the dispersal mechanisms of many desert plants, the whole dead skeleton of Anastatica hierochuntica is involved in seed dispersal and preservation. This process depends on the hygrochastic nature of the lignified conducting tissue that bends when dry and straightens under wet conditions. An anatomical interpretation of this mechanical movement was investigated.METHODSAn anatomical study of the stem was conducted on the juvenile plants raised under different water treatments and on the branch-orders of adult A. hierochuntica size-classes.KEY RESULTSIn the juvenile stem of A. hierochuntica, the area of cortex, conducting tissue and pith increased with water availability. However, the hydraulic conductance decreased, resulting in a better withdrawal of water in water-stressed plants. The anatomical investigation of the hygrochastic mechanism revealed an asymmetric distribution of the cortical tissues, with the conducting tissues of the stem of juvenile and adult plants being larger in the lower side. The hydraulic conductance was better in the basal and middle branch-orders than the terminal ones, permitting better conductance of water to the subsequent branch-orders.CONCLUSIONSThe lignified conducting tissue of the whole stem, having a hygrochastic nature, controls the movement of the branches. The greater amount of conducting tissue associated with a higher density of wide xylem vessels was observed in the lower side of the stem as compared with the upper side. Consequently, the conducting tissue in the lower side of the stem was suggested to be more effective in the opening process of the curled dry branches through better and more rapid conductance of water. Alternatively, due to the few narrow xylem vessels in the upper side of the stem, it was likely that the conducting tissue in the upper side is more effective in the closing process by providing more rapid drying. The mechanical rise of water and the related hygrochastic efficiency were maximized in the basal and middle branch-orders that are mostly involved in the mechanical movement.",TRUE
Anatomically diverse butterfly scales all produce structural colours by coherent scattering,"SUMMARY The structural colours of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) have been attributed to a diversity of physical mechanisms, including multilayer interference, diffraction, Bragg scattering, Tyndall scattering and Rayleigh scattering. We used fibre optic spectrophotometry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and 2D Fourier analysis to investigate the physical mechanisms of structural colour production in twelve lepidopteran species from four families, representing all of the previously proposed anatomical and optical classes of butterfly nanostructure. The 2D Fourier analyses of TEMs of colour producing butterfly scales document that all species are appropriately nanostructured to produce visible colours by coherent scattering, i.e. differential interference and reinforcement of scattered, visible wavelengths. Previously hypothesized to produce a blue colour by incoherent, Tyndall scattering, the scales of Papilio zalmoxis are not appropriately nanostructured for incoherent scattering. Rather, available data indicate that the blue of P. zalmoxis is a fluorescent pigmentary colour. Despite their nanoscale anatomical diversity, all structurally coloured butterfly scales share a single fundamental physical color production mechanism - coherent scattering. Recognition of this commonality provides a new perspective on how the nanostructure and optical properties of structurally coloured butterfly scales evolved and diversified among and within lepidopteran clades.",TRUE
Animal communication: Tree-hole frogs exploit resonance effects,"Animal mating calls that exert a comparatively high sound pressure propagate over greater distances and generally have greater attractive power. Here we show that calling male Bornean tree-hole frogs (Metaphrynella sundana) actively exploit the acoustic properties of cavities in tree trunks that are partially filled with water and which are primarily used as egg-deposition sites. By tuning their vocalizations to the resonant frequency of the hole, which varies with the amount of water that it contains, these frogs enhance their chances of attracting females.",TRUE
Ant collective cognition allows for efficient navigation through disordered environments,"The cognitive abilities of biological organisms only make sense in the context of their environment. Here, we study longhorn crazy ant collective navigation skills within the context of a semi-natural, randomized environment. Mapping this biological setting into the ‚ÄòAnt-in-a-Labyrinth‚Äô framework which studies physical transport through disordered media allows us to formulate precise links between the statistics of environmental challenges and the ants‚Äô collective navigation abilities. We show that, in this environment, the ants use their numbers to collectively extend their sensing range. Although this extension is moderate, it nevertheless allows for extremely fast traversal times that overshadow known physical solutions to the ‚ÄòAnt-in-a-Labyrinth‚Äô problem. To explain this large payoff, we use percolation theory and prove that whenever the labyrinth is solvable, a logarithmically small sensing range suffices for extreme speedup. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential advantages of group living and collective cognition in increasing a species‚Äô habitable range.",TRUE
Ant search strategies after interrupted tandem runs,"SUMMARY Tandem runs are a form of recruitment in ants. During a tandem run, a single leader teaches one follower the route to important resources such as sources of food or better nest sites. In the present study, we investigate what tandem leaders and followers do, in the context of nest emigration, if their partner goes missing. Our experiments involved removing either leaders or followers at set points during tandem runs. Former leaders first stand still and wait for their missing follower but then most often proceed alone to the new nest site. By contrast, former followers often first engage in a Brownian search, for almost exactly the time that their former leader should have waited for them, and then former followers switch to a superdiffusive search. In this way, former followers first search their immediate neighbourhood for their lost leader before becoming ever more wide ranging so that in the absence of their former leader they can often find the new nest, re-encounter the old one or meet a new leader. We also show that followers gain useful information even from incomplete tandem runs. These observations point to the important principle that sophisticated communication behaviours may have evolved as anytime algorithms, i.e. procedures that are beneficial even if they do not run to completion.",TRUE
Ant semiochemicals limit apterous aphid dispersal,"Some organisms can manipulate the nervous systems of others or alter their physiology in order to obtain benefit. Ants are known to limit alate aphid dispersal by physically removing wings and also through chemical manipulation of the alate developmental pathway. This results in reduced dispersal and higher local densities of aphids, which benefit ants in terms of increased honeydew and prey availability. Here, we show that the walking movement of mutualistic apterous aphids is also reduced by ant semiochemicals. Aphids walk slower and their dispersal from an unsuitable patch is hampered by ants. If aphid walking dispersal has evolved as a means of natural enemy escape, then ant chemicals may act as a signal indicating protection; hence, reduced dispersal could be adaptive for aphids. If, however, dispersal is primarily a means to reduce competition or to maintain persistent metapopulations, then manipulation by ants could be detrimental. Such manipulation strategies, common in host‚Äìparasite and predator‚Äìprey interactions, may be more common in mutualism than expected.",TRUE
"Antibacterial properties of larval secretions of the blowfly, Lucilia sericata","Abstract.‚ÄÇ The antibacterial properties of secretions aseptically collected from larvae of the greenbottle fly Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) were examined.

These include the Gram‚Äêpositive Staphylococcus aureus, both methicillin‚Äêresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin‚Äêsensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Streptococcus pyogenes and to a lesser extent the Gram‚Äênegative Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Antifreeze activity of Antarctic fish glycoprotein and a synthetic polymer,"Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) and proteins isolated from the sera of some polar fish species and overwintering insects are able to depress the freezing temperature of the aqueous body fluids (and of water) by means of a non-col ligative mechanism1,2. All previous measurements of the antifreeze effect have been performed on bulk samples under conditions where ice nucleation would be catalysed by participate impurities, giving limited and indeterminate degrees of undercooling. We report the first measurements of homogeneous (spontaneous) ice nucleation rates in deeply under-cooled (<233 K) solutions of AFGP and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), a well-characterized polymer which finds use as a cryoprotectant. Antifreeze activity is said3 to derive from the sorption of AFGP molecules on the active growth sites of ice crystals, preventing normal growth and inducing unusual crystal habits. We have performed experiments on the inhibition of ice crystal growth in solutions containing AFGP and PVP under standardized conditions, and find that the homogeneous nucleation and crystallization rates are sensitive to low concentrations of both substances, but AFGP is remarkably effective at inhibiting ice crystal growth.",TRUE
Antifungal symbiotic peptide NCR044 exhibits unique structure and multifaceted mechanisms of action that confer plant protection,"Significance Several nodule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR) peptides expressed in a model legume Medicago truncatula exhibit potent antimicrobial activity. However, their structure‚Äìactivity relationships and mechanisms of action against fungal pathogens of plants are still largely unknown. A small highly cationic peptide NCR044 with potent antifungal activity has been identified. This peptide has a unique highly dynamic structure and exhibits multifaceted mechanisms of action against a fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Exogenous application of this peptide confers resistance to a gray mold disease caused by B. cinerea in tobacco and tomato plants as well as postharvest products. Our work paves the way for future development of NCR peptides as spray-on antifungal agents. In the indeterminate nodules of a model legume Medicago truncatula, ‚àº700 nodule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR) peptides with conserved cysteine signature are expressed. NCR peptides are highly diverse in sequence, and some of these cationic peptides exhibit antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding their structural architecture, antifungal activity, and modes of action against plant fungal pathogens. Here, the three-dimensional NMR structure of the 36-amino acid NCR044 peptide was solved. This unique structure was largely disordered and highly dynamic with one four-residue Œ±-helix and one three-residue antiparallel Œ≤-sheet stabilized by two disulfide bonds. NCR044 peptide also exhibited potent fungicidal activity against multiple plant fungal pathogens, including Botrytis cinerea and three Fusarium spp. It inhibited germination in quiescent spores of B. cinerea. In germlings, it breached the fungal plasma membrane and induced reactive oxygen species. It bound to multiple bioactive phosphoinositides in vitro. Time-lapse confocal and superresolution microscopy revealed strong fungal cell wall binding, penetration of the cell membrane at discrete foci, followed by gradual loss of turgor, subsequent accumulation in the cytoplasm, and elevated levels in nucleoli of germlings. Spray-applied NCR044 significantly reduced gray mold disease symptoms caused by the fungal pathogen B. cinerea in tomato and tobacco plants, and postharvest products. Our work illustrates the antifungal activity of a structurally unique NCR peptide against plant fungal pathogens and paves the way for future development of this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide.",TRUE
"Antimicrobial secretions and social immunity in larval burying beetles, Nicrophorus vespilloides","Offspring of many animals develop in environments in which they are exposed to high densities of potentially harmful bacteria. For example, larvae of the carrion beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides face significant challenges from the bacteria they encounter during their development on decomposing vertebrate carcasses. We tested the idea that larvae secrete antimicrobial compounds during development to defend themselves against microbial exposure. We first showed that larval secretion of active antimicrobials peaked during the early stages of development. As has been found previously for parental secretions, larval secretions were active against Gram-positive but not Gram-negative bacteria, indicating that they might be based on lysozyme-like compounds. Finally, consistent with this antibacterial activity, we showed that larval survival declined significantly when challenged with lysozyme-resistant Staphylococcus aureus but not when challenged with a lysozyme-susceptible strain of the same species. These results demonstrate that Nicrophorus larvae are not simply passive recipients of social immunity derived from their parents, but that they are active participants in its production.",TRUE
Antipredatory properties of an animal architecture: how complex faecal cases thwart arthropod attack,"Animals create a wide variety of structures to deal with abiotic and biotic challenges. We evaluated an intriguing structure whose function has never been thoroughly tested. Specifically, we evaluated the hypothesis that the body-enclosing ‚Äòfaecal case‚Äô created and lived in by the immature stages of Neochlamisus leaf beetles reduces their risk of predation. We especially focus on the case of N. platani, which is externally covered with host-plant trichomes, and includes a distinct trichome-filled chamber (‚Äòattic‚Äô) in the case apex. Here, we separately evaluated the effects of case, trichomes and attic on each of several behavioural stages of predator attack using N. platani and N. bimaculatus larvae and pupae. Three generalist predators (crickets, soldier bugs and lynx spiders) that represent different feeding strategies were used in our individual-level repeated observation behavioural trials. Results strongly demonstrated that the faecal case itself greatly reduced predation risk for all combinations of beetle species, life history stage and predator. Additional evidence indicated that both trichomes and attics further and independently reduced predation risk. Variation in results among treatments was also informative. For example, the capacity of faecal case components to reduce predation sometimes varied markedly among predators and between larval versus pupal life stages. Patterns of predator behaviour provided no evidence that caseless larvae have alternative means of defence. This study further presents a rare example of the co-option of a physical plant defence (trichomes) by an herbivore.",TRUE
Antiviral and virucidal effects of curcumin on transmissible gastroenteritis virus in vitro.,"Emerging coronaviruses represent serious threats to human and animal health worldwide, and no approved therapeutics are currently available. Here, we used Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) as the alpha-coronavirus model, and investigated the antiviral properties of curcumin against TGEV. Our results demonstrated that curcumin strongly inhibited TGEV proliferation and viral protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. We also observed that curcumin exhibited direct virucidal abilities in a dose-, temperature- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, time-of-addition assays showed that curcumin mainly acted in the early phase of TGEV replication. Notably, in an adsorption assay, curcumin at 40‚Äâ¬µM resulted in a reduction in viral titres of 3.55 log TCID50 ml-1, indicating that curcumin possesses excellent inhibitory effects on the adsorption of TGEV. Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time that curcumin has virucidal activity and virtual inhibition against TGEV, suggesting that curcumin might be a candidate drug for effective control of TGEV infection.",TRUE
Ants recognize foes and not friends,"Discriminating among individuals and rejecting non-group members is essential for the evolution and stability of animal societies. Ants are good models for studying recognition mechanisms, because they are typically very efficient in discriminating ‚Äòfriends‚Äô (nest-mates) from ‚Äòfoes‚Äô (non-nest-mates). Recognition in ants involves multicomponent cues encoded in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. Here, we tested whether workers of the carpenter ant Camponotus herculeanus use the presence and/or absence of cuticular hydrocarbons to discriminate between nest-mates and non-nest-mates. We supplemented the cuticular profile with synthetic hydrocarbons mixed to liquid food and then assessed behavioural responses using two different bioassays. Our results show that (i) the presence, but not the absence, of an additional hydrocarbon elicited aggression and that (ii) among the three classes of hydrocarbons tested (unbranched, mono-methylated and dimethylated alkanes; for mono-methylated alkanes, we present a new synthetic pathway), only the dimethylated alkane was effective in eliciting aggression. Our results suggest that carpenter ants use a fundamentally different mechanism for nest-mate recognition than previously thought. They do not specifically recognize nest-mates, but rather recognize and reject non-nest-mates bearing odour cues that are novel to their own colony cuticular hydrocarbon profile. This begs for a reappraisal of the mechanisms underlying recognition systems in social insects.",TRUE
Application of P450s for biosensing: combination of biotechnology and electrochemistry,Abstract P 450s are heme-containing proteins which catalyze monooxygenation and other reactions in oxidative metabolism of lipophilic compounds. They are promising enzymes for the application of biosensing probes. Biosensing of various compounds is possible when P 450s are immobilized on oxygen electrode or on ion-sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET). Competition assay with other substrate is another biosensing method based on the biochemical assay. Optical biosensor based on a resonance mirror was also reported. Genes in the upstream region of P 450 gene including the promoter is utilized to construct reporter gene system (RGS). The system responds to a trace amount of endocrine-disrupting substance to induce luciferase. Various biosensing methods with P 450s and P 450-related genes will be useful for medical application and ecological application in the near future.,TRUE
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in alleviation of salt stress: a review.,"BACKGROUNDSalt stress has become a major threat to plant growth and productivity. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonize plant root systems and modulate plant growth in various ways.SCOPEThis review addresses the significance of arbuscular mycorrhiza in alleviation of salt stress and their beneficial effects on plant growth and productivity. It also focuses on recent progress in unravelling biochemical, physiological and molecular mechanisms in mycorrhizal plants to alleviate salt stress.CONCLUSIONSThe role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in alleviating salt stress is well documented. This paper reviews the mechanisms arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi employ to enhance the salt tolerance of host plants such as enhanced nutrient acquisition (P, N, Mg and Ca), maintenance of the K(+) : Na(+) ratio, biochemical changes (accumulation of proline, betaines, polyamines, carbohydrates and antioxidants), physiological changes (photosynthetic efficiency, relative permeability, water status, abscissic acid accumulation, nodulation and nitrogen fixation), molecular changes (the expression of genes: PIP, Na(+)/H(+) antiporters, Lsnced, Lslea and LsP5CS) and ultra-structural changes.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis modulates antioxidant response in salt-stressed Trigonella foenum-graecum plants,"An experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of Glomus intraradices colonization on the activity of antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (PX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR)] and the accumulation of nonenzymatic antioxidants (ascorbic acid, Œ±-tocopherol, glutathione, and carotenoids) in roots and leaves of fenugreek plants subjected to varying degrees of salinity (0, 50, 100, and 200¬†mM NaCl) at two time intervals (1 and 14¬†days after saline treatment, DAT). The antioxidative capacity was correlated with oxidative damage in the same tissue. Under salt stress, lipid peroxidation and H2O2 concentration increased with increasing severity and duration of salt stress (DoS). However, the extent of oxidative damage in mycorrhizal plants was less compared to nonmycorrhizal plants. The study reveals that mycorrhiza-mediated attenuation of oxidative stress in fenugreek plants is due to enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes and higher concentrations of antioxidant molecules. However, the significant effect of G. intraradices colonization on individual antioxidant molecules and enzymes varied with plant tissue, salinity level, and DoS. The significant effect of G. intraradices colonization on antioxidative enzymes was more evident at 1DAT in both leaves and roots, while the concentrations of antioxidant molecules were significantly influenced at 14DAT. It is proposed that AM symbiosis can improve antioxidative defense systems of plants through higher SOD activity in M plants, facilitating rapid dismutation of O2- to H2O2, and subsequent prevention of H2O2 build-up by higher activities of CAT, APX, and PX. The potential of G. intraradices to ameliorate oxidative stress generated in fenugreek plants by salinity was more evident at higher intensities of salt stress.",TRUE
Architecture and material properties of diatom shells provide effective mechanical protection,"Diatoms are the major contributors to phytoplankton blooms in lakes and in the sea and hence are central in aquatic ecosystems and the global carbon cycle. All free-living diatoms differ from other phytoplankton groups in having silicified cell walls in the form of two ‚Äòshells‚Äô (the frustule) of manifold shape and intricate architecture whose function and role, if any, in contributing to the evolutionary success of diatoms is under debate. We explored the defence potential of the frustules as armour against predators by measuring their strength. Real and virtual loading tests (using calibrated glass microneedles and finite element analysis) were performed on centric and pennate diatom cells. Here we show that the frustules are remarkably strong by virtue of their architecture and the material properties of the diatom silica. We conclude that diatom frustules have evolved as mechanical protection for the cells because exceptional force is required to break them. The evolutionary arms race between diatoms and their specialized predators will have had considerable influence in structuring pelagic food webs and biogeochemical cycles.",TRUE
Architecture of a catalytically active homotrimeric plant cellulose synthase complex,"Plant cell wall construction crew Plants produce a complex cell wall in which cellulose, a glucose polymer, is a major component. Cellulose fibers are formed from close-packed single chains of cellulose that have been proposed to be formed by multimeric complexes (18 or more subunits) of the enzyme cellulose synthase, which exists in several isoforms. Purushotham et al. determined a cryo‚Äìelectron microscopy structure of a trimer of a single isoform of cellulose synthase. A large channel forms a path for cellulose chains through the membrane-embedded complex. The structure also reveals oligomeric interfaces and provides a framework for modeling the larger complexes seen in plant membranes. The close arrangement of exit sites for nascent glycan chains is consistent with the enzyme complex playing a role in directing cellulose microfibril formation. Science, this issue p. 1089 The structure of a homotrimeric cellulose synthase complex provides molecular insights into cellulose fibril formation. Cellulose is an essential plant cell wall component and represents the most abundant biopolymer on Earth. Supramolecular plant cellulose synthase complexes organize multiple linear glucose polymers into microfibrils as load-bearing wall components. We determined the structure of a poplar cellulose synthase CesA homotrimer that suggests a molecular basis for cellulose microfibril formation. This complex, stabilized by cytosolic plant-conserved regions and helical exchange within the transmembrane segments, forms three channels occupied by nascent cellulose polymers. Secretion steers the polymers toward a common exit point, which could facilitate protofibril formation. CesA‚Äôs N-terminal domains assemble into a cytosolic stalk that interacts with a microtubule-tethering protein and may thus be involved in CesA localization. Our data suggest how cellulose synthase complexes assemble and provide the molecular basis for plant cell wall engineering.",TRUE

Aspilia spp. Leaves: A puzzle in the feeding behavior of wild chimpanzees,"Unlike other chimpanzee food items, the leaves ofAspilia pluriseta, A. rudis and A. mossambicensis (Compositae) are eaten without being chewed.

This unusual behavior suggests thatAspilia leaves offer peculiar stimuli, perhaps with pharmacological effects.",TRUE
Assembly mechanism of recombinant spider silk proteins,"Spider silk threads are formed by the irreversible aggregation of silk proteins in a spinning duct with dimensions of only a few micrometers. Here, we present a microfluidic device in which engineered and recombinantly produced spider dragline silk proteins eADF3 (engineered Araneus diadematus fibroin) and eADF4 are assembled into fibers. Our approach allows the direct observation and identification of the essential parameters of dragline silk assembly. Changes in ionic conditions and pH result in aggregation of the two proteins. Assembly of eADF3 fibers was induced only in the presence of an elongational flow component. Strikingly, eADF4 formed fibers only in combination with eADF3. On the basis of these results, we propose a model for dragline silk aggregation and early steps of fiber assembly in the microscopic regime.",TRUE
Assessment of the Phytotoxic Potential of m-Tyrosine in Laboratory Soil Bioassays,"The significance of soil-allelochemical interactions was addressed in this paper through studies conducted with m-tyrosine, an amino acid analogue and a potent plant growth inhibitor, in a series of laboratory assays performed in field soil or growth media. The studies were performed as a basis for further evaluation of m-tyrosine activity in field soils containing living plant roots. Here, we examined the role of common soil amendments, including ammonium nitrate fertilizer and activated carbon, in overcoming plant growth inhibition in soils in a laboratory setting by using lettuce as a sensitive indicator of plant toxicity. The phytotoxicity of m-tyrosine was not influenced significantly by soil N amendment; however, when significant amounts of activated carbon were added to the soil medium, growth inhibition in treated lettuce seedlings was strongly reduced. Soil texture did not influence the bioavailability or activity of m-tyrosine, as activity in high organic growth media was similar to that of sand and soil mixtures. Similar to other purported allelochemicals, soil persistence of m-tyrosine was limited, with a predicted half life of less than 1¬†day in soil in a controlled laboratory setting. Rapid degradation of this molecule likely was due to microbial activity but degradation did not appear to be influenced significantly by soil N amendment. Given the observed activity of m-tyrosine in soil and growth media on seedling growth, potential may exist for development of m-tyrosine as a soil applied herbicide if formulations can be stabilized under soil conditions.",TRUE
"Attachment to challenging substrates ‚Äì fouling, roughness and limits of adhesion in the northern clingfish (Gobiesox maeandricus)","Northern clingfish use a ventral suction disc to stick to rough substrates in the intertidal zone. Bacteria, algae and invertebrates grow on these surfaces (fouling) and change the surface properties of the primary substrate, and therefore the attachment conditions for benthic organisms. In this study, we investigate the influence of fouling and surface roughness on the adhesive strength of northern clingfish, Gobiesox maeandricus. We measured clingfish tenacity on unfouled and fouled substrates over four surface roughnesses. We exposed surfaces for 6 weeks in the Pacific Ocean, until they were covered with periphyton. Clingfish tenacity is equivalent on both fouled and unfouled smooth substrates; however, tenacity on fouled rough surfaces is less compared with tenacity on unfouled ones. We hypothesize that parts of biofilm may act as a lubricant and decrease friction of the disc margin, thereby making disc margins slip inwards and fail at lower tenacities. Nevertheless, even on fouled surfaces the adhesive forces are approximately 150 times the body weight of the fish. To identify the upper threshold of surface roughness the fish can cling to, we tested seven unfouled substrates of increasing surface roughness. The threshold roughness at which northern clingfish failed increased with specimen size. We hypothesize that because of the elastic properties of the disc margin, a larger disc can adapt to larger surface irregularities. The largest specimens (length 10‚Äì12 cm) were able to cling to surfaces with 2‚Äì4 mm grain size. The fish can attach to surfaces with roughness between 2 and 9% of the suction disc width.",TRUE
Attachment-based mechanisms underlying capture and release of pollen grains,"Successful insect pollination can be achieved by a sequence of numerous attachment and detachment events at various biological surfaces. However, the quantitative measurements of pollen adhesion on biological surfaces have been poorly studied so far. We performed atomic force microscopy adhesion measurements of pollen on two most important floral parts for Asteraceae in a course of pollination: the stigma and style of Hypochaeris radicata plant. The results indicated distinct adhesive properties of them‚Äîthe pollen adhesion on stigmatic surfaces drastically increased over prolonged contact time, while the pollen adhesion increase on stylar surfaces was rather restrained. Based on the observation with cryo-scanning electron microscopy, we explained the experimental results by the presence of morphological features in form of flexible stigmatic papillae that may play a crucial role in enhancing both capillary attraction and van der Waals forces. The distinct adhesive properties seemingly originate from the unique adhesive tasks that each of the floral parts requires to achieve successful pollination. The insights into the adhesive interaction between pollen and the floral parts, obtained in the present study, may lead to better understanding of pollination mechanisms, which are strongly related to our food production. Additionally, the novel pollen adhesive mechanisms learned from the stigma of the studied Asteraceae plant can inspire biomimetic designs of spontaneous gripping systems.",TRUE
Attractive and defensive functions of the ultraviolet pigments of a flower (Hypericum calycinum),"The flower of Hypericum calycinum, which appears uniformly yellow to humans, bears a UV pattern, presumably visible to insects. Two categories of pigments, flavonoids and dearomatized isoprenylated phloroglucinols (DIPs), are responsible for the UV demarcations of this flower. Flavonoids had been shown previously to function as floral UV pigments, but DIPs had not been demonstrated to serve in that capacity. We found the DIPs to be present in high concentration in the anthers and ovarian wall of the flower, suggesting that the compounds also serve in defense. Indeed, feeding tests done with one of the DIPs (hypercalin A) showed the compound to be deterrent and toxic to a caterpillar (Utetheisa ornatrix). The possibility that floral UV pigments fulfill both a visual and a defensive function had not previously been contemplated. DIPs may also serve for protection of female reproductive structures in other plants, for example in hops (Humulus lupulus). The DIPs of hops are put to human use as bitter flavoring agents and preservatives in beer.",TRUE
Auditory Spatial Acuity Approximates the Resolving Power of Space-Specific Neurons,"The relationship between neuronal acuity and behavioral performance was assessed in the barn owl (Tyto alba), a nocturnal raptor renowned for its ability to localize sounds and for the topographic representation of auditory space found in the midbrain. We measured discrimination of sound-source separation using a newly developed procedure involving the habituation and recovery of the pupillary dilation response. The smallest discriminable change of source location was found to be about two times finer in azimuth than in elevation. Recordings from neurons in its midbrain space map revealed that their spatial tuning, like the spatial discrimination behavior, was also better in azimuth than in elevation by a factor of about two. Because the PDR behavioral assay is mediated by the same circuitry whether discrimination is assessed in azimuth or in elevation, this difference in vertical and horizontal acuity is likely to reflect a true difference in sensory resolution, without additional confounding effects of differences in motor performance in the two dimensions. Our results, therefore, are consistent with the hypothesis that the acuity of the midbrain space map determines auditory spatial discrimination.",TRUE
Automatic control: the vertebral column of dogfish sharks behaves as a continuously variable transmission with smoothly shifting functions,"ABSTRACT During swimming in dogfish sharks, Squalus acanthias, both the intervertebral joints and the vertebral centra undergo significant strain. To investigate this system, unique among vertebrates, we cyclically bent isolated segments of 10 vertebrae and nine joints. For the first time in the biomechanics of fish vertebral columns, we simultaneously characterized non-linear elasticity and viscosity throughout the bending oscillation, extending recently proposed techniques for large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) characterization to large-amplitude oscillatory bending (LAOB). The vertebral column segments behave as non-linear viscoelastic springs. Elastic properties dominate for all frequencies and curvatures tested, increasing as either variable increases. Non-linearities within a bending cycle are most in evidence at the highest frequency, 2.0‚ÄÖHz, and curvature, 5‚ÄÖm‚àí1. Viscous bending properties are greatest at low frequencies and high curvatures, with non-linear effects occurring at all frequencies and curvatures. The range of mechanical behaviors includes that of springs and brakes, with smooth transitions between them that allow for continuously variable power transmission by the vertebral column to assist in the mechanics of undulatory propulsion. Highlighted Article: Characterization of non-linear elasticity and viscosity throughout the bending oscillation reveals that the shark vertebral column behaves as both a spring and a brake, with smooth transitions between them for continuously variable power transmission.",TRUE
Avoidance and tolerance of freezing in ectothermic vertebrates,"Summary Ectothermic vertebrates have colonized regions that are seasonally or perpetually cold, and some species, particularly terrestrial hibernators, must cope with temperatures that fall substantially below 0¬∞C. Survival of such excursions depends on either freeze avoidance through supercooling or freeze tolerance. Supercooling, a metastable state in which body fluids remain liquid below the equilibrium freezing/melting point, is promoted by physiological responses that protect against chilling injury and by anatomical and behavioral traits that limit risk of inoculative freezing by environmental ice and ice-nucleating agents. Freeze tolerance evolved from responses to fundamental stresses to permit survival of the freezing of a substantial amount of body water under thermal and temporal conditions of ecological relevance. Survival of freezing is promoted by a complex suite of molecular, biochemical and physiological responses that limit cell death from excessive shrinkage, damage to macromolecules and membranes, metabolic perturbation and oxidative stress. Although freeze avoidance and freeze tolerance generally are mutually exclusive strategies, a few species can switch between them, the mode used in a particular instance of chilling depending on prevailing physiological and environmental conditions.",TRUE
Avoidance of Catastrophic Structural Failure as an Evolutionary Constraint: Biomechanics of the Acorn Weevil Rostrum.,"The acorn weevil (Curculio Linnaeus, 1758) rostrum (snout) exhibits remarkable flexibility and toughness derived from the microarchitecture of its exoskeleton. Modifications to the composite profile of the rostral cuticle that simultaneously enhance the flexibility and toughness of the distal portion of the snout are characterized. Using classical laminate plate theory, the effect of these modifications on the elastic behavior of the exoskeleton is estimated. It is shown that the tensile behavior of the rostrum across six Curculio species with high morphological variation correlates with changes in the relative layer thicknesses and orientation angles of layers in the exoskeleton. Accordingly, increased endocuticle thickness is strongly correlated with increased tensile strength. Rostrum stiffness is shown to be inversely correlated with work of fracture; thus allowing a highly curved rostrum to completely straighten without structural damage. Finally, exocuticle rich invaginations of the occipital sutures are identified both as a likely site of crack initiation in tensile failure and as a source of morphological constraint on the evolution of the rostrum in Curculio weevils. It is concluded that avoidance of catastrophic structural failure, as initiated in these sutures under tension, is the driving selective pressure in the evolution of the female Curculio rostrum.",TRUE
B cell zone reticular cell microenvironments shape CXCL13 gradient formation,"Through the formation of concentration gradients, morphogens drive graded responses to extracellular signals, thereby fine-tuning cell behaviors in complex tissues. Here we show that the chemokine CXCL13 forms both soluble and immobilized gradients. Specifically, CXCL13+ follicular reticular cells form a small-world network of guidance structures, with computer simulations and optimization analysis predicting that immobilized gradients created by this network promote B cell trafficking. Consistent with this prediction, imaging analysis show that CXCL13 binds to extracellular matrix components in situ, constraining its diffusion. CXCL13 solubilization requires the protease cathepsin B that cleaves CXCL13 into a stable product. Mice lacking cathepsin B display aberrant follicular architecture, a phenotype associated with effective B cell homing to but not within lymph nodes. Our data thus suggest that reticular cells of the B cell zone generate microenvironments that shape both immobilized and soluble CXCL13 gradients. Morphogens such as chemokines form gradients to direct graded responses and modulate cell behaviors. Here the authors show, using imaging and computer simulation, that the chemokine CXCL13 originated from follicular reticular cells in the lymph nodes forms both soluble and immobilized gradients to regulate B cell recruitment and migration.",TRUE
Bacterial biofilm shows persistent resistance to liquid wetting and gas penetration,"Most of the world‚Äôs bacteria exist in robust, sessile communities known as biofilms, ubiquitously adherent to environmental surfaces from ocean floors to human teeth and notoriously resistant to antimicrobial agents. We report the surprising observation that Bacillus subtilis biofilm colonies and pellicles are extremely nonwetting, greatly surpassing the repellency of Teflon toward water and lower surface tension liquids. The biofilm surface remains nonwetting against up to 80% ethanol as well as other organic solvents and commercial biocides across a large and clinically important concentration range. We show that this property limits the penetration of antimicrobial liquids into the biofilm, severely compromising their efficacy. To highlight the mechanisms of this phenomenon, we performed experiments with mutant biofilms lacking ECM components and with functionalized polymeric replicas of biofilm microstructure. We show that the nonwetting properties are a synergistic result of ECM composition, multiscale roughness, reentrant topography, and possibly yet other factors related to the dynamic nature of the biofilm surface. Finally, we report the impenetrability of the biofilm surface by gases, implying defense capability against vapor-phase antimicrobials as well. These remarkable properties of B. subtilis biofilm, which may have evolved as a protection mechanism against native environmental threats, provide a new direction in both antimicrobial research and bioinspired liquid-repellent surface paradigms.",TRUE
Bacterial chemolithoautotrophy via manganese oxidation,"Manganese is one of the most abundant elements on Earth. The oxidation of manganese has long been theorized1‚Äîyet has not been demonstrated2‚Äì4‚Äîto fuel the growth of chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms. Here we refine an enrichment culture that exhibits exponential growth dependent on Mn(II) oxidation to a co-culture of two microbial species. Oxidation required viable bacteria at permissive temperatures, which resulted in the generation of small nodules of manganese oxide with which the cells associated. The majority member of the culture‚Äîwhich we designate ‚ÄòCandidatus Manganitrophus noduliformans‚Äô‚Äîis affiliated to the phylum Nitrospirae (also known as Nitrospirota), but is distantly related to known species of Nitrospira and Leptospirillum.

Stable-isotope probing revealed 13CO2 fixation into cellular biomass that was dependent upon Mn(II) oxidation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed candidate pathways for coupling extracellular manganese oxidation to aerobic energy conservation and autotrophic CO2 fixation. These findings expand the known diversity of inorganic metabolisms that support life, and complete a biogeochemical energy cycle for manganese5,6 that may interface with other major global elemental cycles.

Bacterial microcompartments,"Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are self-assembling organelles that consist of an enzymatic core that is encapsulated by a selectively permeable protein shell.

They contribute to the metabolic versatility of bacteria, providing a competitive advantage in specific environmental niches. Although BMCs were first visualized more than 60 years ago, it is mainly in the past decade that progress has been made in understanding their metabolic diversity and the structural basis of their assembly and function. This progress has not only heightened our understanding of their role in microbial metabolism but is also beginning to enable their use in a variety of applications in synthetic biology.

Bacterial rhodopsin: evidence for a new type of phototrophy in the sea.,"Extremely halophilic archaea contain retinal-binding integral membrane proteins called bacteriorhodopsins that function as light-driven proton pumps. So far, bacteriorhodopsins capable of generating a chemiosmotic membrane potential in response to light have been demonstrated only in halophilic archaea. We describe here a type of rhodopsin derived from bacteria that was discovered through genomic analyses of naturally occuring marine bacterioplankton. The bacterial rhodopsin was encoded in the genome of an uncultivated gamma-proteobacterium and shared highest amino acid sequence similarity with archaeal rhodopsins. The protein was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli and bound retinal to form an active, light-driven proton pump. The new rhodopsin exhibited a photochemical reaction cycle with intermediates and kinetics characteristic of archaeal proton-pumping rhodopsins. Our results demonstrate that archaeal-like rhodopsins are broadly distributed among different taxa, including members of the domain Bacteria. Our data also indicate that a previously unsuspected mode of bacterially mediated light-driven energy generation may commonly occur in oceanic surface waters worldwide.",TRUE

Ballistic tongue projection in chameleons maintains high performance at low temperature,"Environmental temperature impacts the physical activity and ecology of ectothermic animals through its effects on muscle contractile physiology. Sprinting, swimming, and jumping performance of ectotherms decreases by at least 33% over a 10 ¬∞C drop, accompanied by a similar decline in muscle power. We propose that ballistic movements that are powered by recoil of elastic tissues are less thermally dependent than movements that rely on direct muscular power. We found that an elastically powered movement, ballistic tongue projection in chameleons, maintains high performance over a 20 ¬∞C range. Peak velocity and power decline by only 10%‚Äì19% with a 10 ¬∞C drop, compared to >42% for nonelastic, muscle-powered tongue retraction. These results indicate that the elastic recoil mechanism circumvents the constraints that low temperature imposes on muscle rate properties and thereby reduces the thermal dependence of tongue projection. We propose that organisms that use elastic recoil mechanisms for ecologically important movements such as feeding and locomotion may benefit from an expanded thermal niche.",TRUE
Bamboo-inspired optimal design for functionally graded hollow cylinders,"The optimal distribution of the reinforcing fibers for stiffening hollow cylindrical composites is explored using the linear elasticity theory. The spatial distribution of the vascular bundles in wild bamboo, a nature-designed functionally graded material, is the basis for the design.

This fact provides us with a plant-mimetic design principle that enables the realization of high-stiffness and lightweight cylindrical composites.",TRUE
Barnacle cement: a polymerization model based on evolutionary concepts,"SUMMARY Enzymes and biochemical mechanisms essential to survival are under extreme selective pressure and are highly conserved through evolutionary time. We applied this evolutionary concept to barnacle cement polymerization, a process critical to barnacle fitness that involves aggregation and cross-linking of proteins. The biochemical mechanisms of cement polymerization remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that this process is biochemically similar to blood clotting, a critical physiological response that is also based on aggregation and cross-linking of proteins. Like key elements of vertebrate and invertebrate blood clotting, barnacle cement polymerization was shown to involve proteolytic activation of enzymes and structural precursors, transglutaminase cross-linking and assembly of fibrous proteins. Proteolytic activation of structural proteins maximizes the potential for bonding interactions with other proteins and with the surface. Transglutaminase cross-linking reinforces cement integrity. Remarkably, epitopes and sequences homologous to bovine trypsin and human transglutaminase were identified in barnacle cement with tandem mass spectrometry and/or western blotting. Akin to blood clotting, the peptides generated during proteolytic activation functioned as signal molecules, linking a molecular level event (protein aggregation) to a behavioral response (barnacle larval settlement). Our results draw attention to a highly conserved protein polymerization mechanism and shed light on a long-standing biochemical puzzle. We suggest that barnacle cement polymerization is a specialized form of wound healing. The polymerization mechanism common between barnacle cement and blood may be a theme for many marine animal glues.",TRUE
Bat wing sensors support flight control,"Bats are the only mammals capable of powered flight, and they perform impressive aerial maneuvers like tight turns, hovering, and perching upside down. The bat wing contains five digits, and its specialized membrane is covered with stiff, microscopically small, domed hairs. We provide here unique empirical evidence that the tactile receptors associated with these hairs are involved in sensorimotor flight control by providing aerodynamic feedback. We found that neurons in bat primary somatosensory cortex respond with directional sensitivity to stimulation of the wing hairs with low-speed airflow. Wing hairs mostly preferred reversed airflow, which occurs under flight conditions when the airflow separates and vortices form. This finding suggests that the hairs act as an array of sensors to monitor flight speed and/or airflow conditions that indicate stall. Depilation of different functional regions of the bats‚Äô wing membrane altered the flight behavior in obstacle avoidance tasks by reducing aerial maneuverability, as indicated by decreased turning angles and increased flight speed.",TRUE
Battle in the Amazon: Arapaima versus Piranha,"The scales of the Arapaimas, a large freshwater fish (up to 200‚Äâkg), are a superb example of a natural material that has evolved to provide protection against predators. The Arapaimas lives primarily in Amazon basin lakes that become infested with piranhas as the dry season advances and is covered with scales having up to 10‚Äâcm length. They have a collagen interior with a highly mineralized external layer. The collagen fibers form a cross-lamellar arrangement which produces a laminate composite. The internal collagenous layer provides the flexibility to the scales, which can undergo significant elastic deformation prior to failure, providing considerable toughness. The mineralized exterior provides the required protection against predation. The flexibility of the biomineral is enabled by two factors: (i) a corrugated configuration in which the tensile strains are minimized; (ii) a graded composition. We propose herein that the structure of the scales, a composite consisting of a mineralized external layer with surface corrugations and an internal flexible collagenous foundation, can serve as inspiration for the design of flexible composites having a hard ceramic surface. The piranha (Serrasalminae) is one of the principal predators in seasonal lakes, in which fish get trapped. Its teeth form triangular arrays creating a guillotine action that is highly effective in slicing through muscle. The bite force is calculated for a piranha with a mass of 1‚Äâkg from estimated maximum force values applied by three muscle groups connecting the jaw to the mandible: it is ‚âà20‚ÄâN. Mechanical tests on the scales and teeth demonstrate that the cutting and puncturing ability of the piranha teeth cannot penetrate the Arapaimas scales.",TRUE
Beaver-induced spatiotemporal patch dynamics affect landscape-level environmental heterogeneity,"Beavers (Castor sp.) are ecosystem engineers that cause significant changes to their physical environment and alter the availability of resources to other species. We studied flood dynamics created by American beaver (C. canadensis K.) in a southern boreal landscape in Finland in 1970-2018. We present for the first time, to our knowledge, a temporally continuous long-term study of beaver-induced flood disturbances starting from the appearance of beaver in the area. During the 49 years, the emergence of new sites flooded by beaver and repeated floods (61% of the sites) formed a dynamic mosaic characterized by clustered patterns of beaver sites. As beaver dispersal proceeded, connectivity of beaver sites increased significantly. The mean flood duration was approximately three years, which highlights the importance of datasets with high-temporal resolution in detecting beaver-induced disturbances. An individual site was often part of the active flood mosaic over several decades, although the duration and the number of repeated floods at different sites varied considerably. Variation of flood-inundated and post-flood phases at individual sites resulted in a cumulative number of unique patches that contribute to environmental heterogeneity in space and time. A disturbance mosaic consisting of patches differing by successional age and flood history is likely to support species richness and abundance of different taxa and facilitate whole species communities. Beavers are thus a suitable means to be used in restoration of riparian habitat due to their strong and dynamic influence on abiotic environment and its biotic consequences.",TRUE
Bile Acid secreted by male sea lamprey that acts as a sex pheromone,"We show that reproductively mature male sea lampreys release a bile acid that acts as a potent sex pheromone, inducing preference and searching behavior in ovulated female lampreys. The secreted bile acid 7alpha,12alpha,24-trihydroxy-5alpha-cholan-3-one 24-sulfate was released in much higher amounts relative to known vertebrate steroid pheromones and may be secreted through the gills. Hence, the male of this fish species signals both its reproductive status and location to females by secreting a pheromone that can act over long distances.",TRUE
Bill sweeping in spoonbills Platalea: no evidence for an effective suction force at the tip,"We analysed the hypothesis of Weihs and Katzir (1994) that feeding spoonbills use their broad bills by sweeping it through the water to shed a vortex. This would result in a hydrodynamic suction on the bottom for catching prey immediately or during the next sweep besides providing some extra benefits. The basic assumptions appear to be erroneous. (1) A spoonbill does not mainly feed on small, benthic invertebrates, but mainly on nekton such as fish and shrimps. (2) The inner surface of the upper mandible of a spoonbill is not concave but convex. (3) During feeding, a spoonbill does not keep its bill tip close to the bottom independent of the water depth. The outcomes of the tests supporting the hypothesis do not hold and the suggested benefits are dubious. Therefore, we reject the hypothesis and the claim that the bill of a spoonbill is used as a hydrofoil. The discussed paper tried to give an explanation of the behaviour of a bird with the help of hydrodynamic formulae. The fundamental mistake in the paper is that the use of the formulae is based on wrong assumptions concerning the food of the bird, its feeding behaviour as well as its anatomical details. The tests with a bird kept in captivity suggesting a proof of the rightness of the hypothesis lack a proper connection to the situation in the wild. Spoonbills (Aves: Ciconiiformes: Threskiornithidae, genus Platalea) are large wading birds characterised by their extremely flattened bills that are widened in the distal parts. The six species are very similar in shape and behaviour, mainly differing in size, colour of legs, bills and other bare parts, and in distribution (Matheu and del Hoyo 1992).

Bioactive Molecular Networking for Mapping the Antimicrobial Constituents of the Baltic Brown Alga Fucus vesiculosus,"The brown alga Fucus vesiculosus is common to the intertidal zones of the Baltic Sea, where it is exposed to high fouling pressures by microorganisms. Our previous studies showed, repeatedly, the consistent antimicrobial activity of F. vesiculosus crude extracts against human pathogens, while untargeted metabolomics analyses have revealed a variety of metabolites. In this study, we applied the UPLC-QToF-MS/MS-based ‚Äúbioactive molecular networking‚Äù (BMN) concept on the most bioactive n-hexane and n-butanol subextracts of Baltic F. vesiculosus coupled with in silico dereplication tools to identify the compounds responsible for antimicrobial activity. The first antimicrobial cluster identified by BMN was galactolipids. Our targeted isolation efforts for this class led to the isolation of six monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) derivatives (1‚Äì6) and one digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG, 7). The MGDGs 5 and 6 and the DGDG 7 exhibited activity against Staphylococcus aureus. The second compound class with high bioactivity was phlorotannins. In particular, phlorethol-type phlorotannins showed high correlations with antimicrobial activity based on the BMN approach, and two phlorotannins (8‚Äì9) were isolated. This study shows that antimicrobial components of F. vesiculosus reside in the algal cell walls and membranes and that BMN provides a complementary tool for the targeted isolation of bioactive metabolites.",TRUE
Biochemical analysis of elastic and rigid cuticles of Cirsium horridulum,"Abstract. The cuticle is a complex structure of soluble lipids, lipid polymers and polysaccharides. In addition to its functions to reduce water loss and provide a protective barrier, its mechanical properties may be significant to plant growth and development. We investigated the cuticle of Cirsium horridulum Michx. because of its involvement in the thigmonastic contraction of staminal filaments. The staminal filaments and portions of the style are surrounded by a highly elastic cuticle in contrast to the rigid cuticle of the corolla and leaves. Our aim was to determine if the biochemical composition affected the elasticity of the cuticle. We discovered that the ratio of carbohydrates to lipids is 1:7 in floral parts but 2:1 in leaf cuticle. Esterified cutin components represented about 80% of the cuticle and di-hydroxyhexadecanoic acids were the major monomers of cutin, regardless of origin. The cutin of elastic tissues is characterized by a higher content of tri-hydroxy monomers than the cutin of rigid tissues. The data suggest that hydroxyl groups enhance the hydrophilic character of the cuticle and contribute to cuticular elasticity.",TRUE
Biochemical characteristics and antibiotic properties of the mucous envelope of the queen parrotfish,The mucous cocoon of the queen parrotfish is an extensive disulphate bonded network of small glycoproteins of about 21 kDa apparent molecular weight.

Biodegradation of Fluoranthene by Basidiomycetes Fungal Isolate Pleurotus Ostreatus HP-1,"The biodegradation of fluoranthene, a high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), was investigated in submerged culture using the wood decaying fungus isolated from forest locality in Gujarat, India. The basidiomycete fungal isolate was found to have an ability to grow on sabaroud dextrose agar containing 50¬†mgl‚àí1 of each naphthalene, anthracene, acenaphthene, benzo (a) anthracene, pyrene, flouranthene, carbazole, and biphenyl. The involvement of extracellular fungal peroxidases such as manganese peroxidase (MnP) and laccase (Phenol oxidase) in the degradation of fluoranthene was studied. On the eighth day of incubation 54.09% of 70¬†mg l‚àí1 fluoranthene was removed. There after no PAHs removal was observed till the 20th day of the incubation period. The isolate was identified as Pleurotus ostreatus by 18S rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, and partial 28S rRNA gene sequencing. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time Pleurotus ostreatus have been reported to degrade such a high concentration of fluoranthene within much lower time period of incubation. Depletion in the residual fluoranthene in the culture medium was determined by HPLC. Attempts were made to identify the degradation product in the culture medium with the help of FT-IR, NMR, and HPTLC analysis. In the present study positive correlation between fluoranthene degradation and the ligninolytic enzyme (MnP and laccase) production is observed, thus this isolate can play an effective role for bioremediation of PAHs contaminated sites.",TRUE
Biodegradation of new quaternary ammonium compounds in treated wood by mould fungi,"The degradation of seven potential wood preservatives based on imidazolium compounds (ICs) and quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) with a modified anion structure by mould fungi was determined using soil-block method. Experiments were carried out on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) wood. Two-phase titration and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method were used to detect and quantify the degradation products. The performed soil-block tests showed that the ICs and QACs with alkoxymethyl substituents were leached from the experimental wood when in contact with moist soil and revealed their fungal detoxification by mould fungi, especially by Gliocladium roseum. The degree of biological decomposition of new compounds was higher than didecyldimethylammonium chloride and didecylmethylpoli(oxyethyl)ammonium propionate. The observations of the colonization by mould fungi were made using the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Decay of treated wood by mould fungi showed its tolerance to QACs.",TRUE
Biodegradation of volatile organic compounds by five fungal species,"Abstract. Five fungal species, Cladosporium resinae (ATCC 34066), Cladosporium sphaerospermum (ATCC 200384), Exophiala lecanii-corni (CBS 102400), Mucor rouxii (ATCC 44260), and Phanerochaete chrysosporium (ATCC 24725), were tested for their ability to degrade nine compounds commonly found in industrial off-gas emissions. Fungal cultures inoculated on ceramic support media were provided with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) via the vapor phase as their sole carbon and energy sources. Compounds tested included aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, and styrene), ketones (methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, and methyl propyl ketone), and organic acids (n-butyl acetate, ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate). Experiments were conducted using three pH values ranging from 3.5 to 6.5. Fungal ability to degrade each VOC was determined by observing the presence or absence of visible growth on the ceramic support medium during a 30-day test period. Results indicate that E. lecanii-corni and C. sphaerospermum can readily utilize each of the nine VOCs as a sole carbon and energy source. P. chrysosporium was able to degrade all VOCs tested except for styrene under the conditions imposed. C. resinae was able to degrade both organic acids, all of the ketones, and some of the aromatic compounds (ethylbenzene and toluene); however, it was not able to grow utilizing benzene or styrene under the conditions tested. With the VOCs tested, M. rouxii produced visible growth only when supplied with n-butyl acetate or ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate. Maximum growth for most fungi was observed at a pH of approximately 5.0. The experimental protocol utilized in these studies is a useful tool for assessing the ability of different fungal species to degrade gas-phase VOCs under conditions expected in a biofilter application.",TRUE
Biofouling: lessons from nature,"Biofouling is generally undesirable for many applications. An overview of the medical, marine and industrial fields susceptible to fouling is presented. Two types of fouling include biofouling from organism colonization and inorganic fouling from non-living particles. Nature offers many solutions to control fouling through various physical and chemical control mechanisms. Examples include low drag, low adhesion, wettability (water repellency and attraction), microtexture, grooming, sloughing, various miscellaneous behaviours and chemical secretions. A survey of nature's flora and fauna was taken in order to discover new antifouling methods that could be mimicked for engineering applications. Antifouling methods currently employed, ranging from coatings to cleaning techniques, are described. New antifouling methods will presumably incorporate a combination of physical and chemical controls.",TRUE
Bioinspired Materials with Self-Adaptable Mechanical Properties.,"Natural structural materials, such as bone, can autonomously modulate their mechanical properties in response to external loading to prevent failure. These material systems smartly control the addition/removal of material in locations of high/low mechanical stress by utilizing local resources guided by biological signals. On the contrary, synthetic structural materials have unchanging mechanical properties limiting their mechanical performance and service life. Inspired by the mineralization process of bone, a material system that adapts its mechanical properties in response to external mechanical loading is reported. It is found that charges from piezoelectric scaffolds can induce mineralization from surrounding media. It is shown that the material system can adapt to external mechanical loading by inducing mineral deposition in proportion to the magnitude of the stress and the resulting piezoelectric charges. Moreover, the mineralization mechanism allows a simple one-step route for fabricating functionally graded materials by controlling the stress distribution along the scaffold. The findings can pave the way for a new class of self-regenerating materials that reinforce regions of high stress or induce deposition of minerals on the damaged areas from the increase in mechanical stress to prevent/mitigate failure. It is envisioned that the findings can contribute to addressing the current challenges of synthetic materials for load-bearing applications from self-adaptive capabilities.",TRUE
Biological characterization of the skin of shortfin mako shark Isurus oxyrinchus and preliminary study of the hydrodynamic behaviour through computational fluid dynamics.,"This study characterized the morphology, density and orientation of the dermal denticles along the body of a shortfin mako shark Isurus oxyrinchus and identified the hydrodynamic parameters of its body through a computational fluid-dynamics model. The study showed a great variability in the morphology, size, shape, orientation and density of dermal denticles along the body of I. oxyrinchus. There was a significant higher density in dorsal and ventral areas of the body and their highest angular deviations were found in the lower part of the mouth and in the areas between the pre-caudal pit and the second dorsal and pelvic fins. A detailed three-dimensional geometry from a scanned body of a shark was carried out to evaluate the hydrodynamic properties such as drag coefficient, lift coefficient and superficial (skin) friction coefficient of the skin together with flow velocity field, according to different roughness coefficients simulating the effect of the dermal denticles. This preliminary approach contributed to detailed information of the denticle interactions. As the height of the denticles was increased, flow velocity and the effect of lift decreased whereas drag increased. The highest peaks of skin friction coefficient were observed around the pectoral fins.",TRUE

"Bioluminescence in the Ocean: Origins of Biological, Chemical, and Ecological Diversity","In Living Color Light produced using the chemical process of bioluminescence spans the entire range of the visible spectrum. Bioluminescence has evolved independently several times in the tree of life. However, the majority of bioluminescent organisms reside in the open ocean, where their bioluminescence helps species in over 700 genera evade predators, attract mates, and find food. Widder (p. 704) reviews recent advances in understanding the evolution and distribution of bioluminescence in marine systems. From bacteria to fish, a remarkable variety of marine life depends on bioluminescence (the chemical generation of light) for finding food, attracting mates, and evading predators. Disparate biochemical systems and diverse phylogenetic distribution patterns of light-emitting organisms highlight the ecological benefits of bioluminescence, with biochemical and genetic analyses providing new insights into the mechanisms of its evolution. The origins and functions of some bioluminescent systems, however, remain obscure. Here, I review recent advances in understanding bioluminescence in the ocean and highlight future research efforts that will unite molecular details with ecological and evolutionary relationships.",TRUE
Bioluminescent signals spatially amplified by wavelength-specific diffusion through the shell of a marine snail,"Some living organisms produce visible light (bioluminescence) for intra- or interspecific visual communication. Here, we describe a remarkable bioluminescent adaptation in the marine snail Hinea brasiliana. This species produces a luminous display in response to mechanical stimulation caused by encounters with other motile organisms. The light is produced from discrete areas on the snail's body beneath the snail's shell, and must thus overcome this structural barrier to be viewed by an external receiver. The diffusion and transmission efficiency of the shell is greater than a commercial diffuser reference material. Most strikingly, the shell, although opaque and pigmented, selectively diffuses the blue-green wavelength of the species bioluminescence. This diffusion generates a luminous display that is enlarged relative to the original light source. This unusual shell thus allows spatially amplified outward transmission of light communication signals from the snail, while allowing the animal to remain safely inside its hard protective shell.",TRUE

Biomechanics: A pneumo-hydrostatic skeleton in land crabs,"Like their aquatic counterparts, terrestrial crabs repeatedly shed their rigid exoskeleton during moulting. But in the case of land crabs, little water is available to provide a temporary hydrostatic skeleton before the new skeleton hardens, and air does not provide the buoyancy necessary to support the animal. Here we show that whenever its exoskeleton is shed, the blackback land crab Gecarcinus lateralis relies on an unconventional type of hydrostatic skeleton that uses both gas and liquid (a ‚Äòpneumo-hydrostat‚Äô). To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence for a locomotor skeleton that depends on a gas. It establishes a new category of hydrostatic skeletal support and possibly a critical adaptation to life on land for the Crustacea.",TRUE
Biomechanics: Turning the key on Drosophila audition,"The genetic dissection of Drosophila audition is advancing considerably, but complementary studies are needed to unravel the chain of mechanosensory events that bring about hearing in the fly.

Rotating in response to sound, the antenna's distal segment mechanically activates the auditory receptors ‚Äî thereby 'unlocking' the mechanism of Drosophila audition.",TRUE
Biomimetic structure design ‚Äî a possible approach to change the brittleness of ceramics in nature‚òÜ,"Based on the analysis on structure of natural biomaterials, two kinds of ceramic composites with high toughness have been designed and prepared: one is fibrous monolithic Si3N4/BN composite imitating bamboos or trees in structure, the other is laminated Si3N4/BN composite imitating nacre in structure. Plastic forming methods, including extrusion and roll compaction, respectively, followed by hot-pressed sintering are used to prepare these two materials with particular structures. Both of the two composites have high values of fracture toughness and work of fracture: fracture toughness are 24 MPa m1/2 and 28 MPa m1/2, respectively, for fibrous monolithic and laminated Si3N4/BN composites, and works of fracture are both more than 4000 J/m2. The load-displacement curves reveal that these two materials with biomimetic structure exhibit non-brittle feature when applied load to fracture. Through analysis on fractographs of the materials, it is revealed that high toughness comes from the synergistic toughening among multi-level toughening mechanisms in different scales: weak interfaces, whiskers and elongated grains toughening in ceramic matrix cells.",TRUE
Biomimetics of campaniform sensilla: Measuring strain from the deformation of holes,"We present a bio-inspired strategy for designing embedded strain sensors in space structures. In insects, the campaniform sensillum is a hole extending through the cuticle arranged such that its shape changes in response to loads. The shape change is rotated through 90¬∞ by the suspension of a bell-shaped cap whose deflection is detected by a cell beneath the cuticle. It can be sensitive to displacements of the order of 1 nm. The essential morphology, a hole formed in a plate of fibrous composite material, was modelled by Skordos et al. who showed that global deformation of the plate (which can be flat, curved or a tube) induces higher local deformation of the hole due to its locally higher compliance. Further developments reported here show that this approach can be applied to groups of holes relative to their orientation.The morphology of the sensillum in insects suggests that greater sensitivity can be achieved by arranging several holes in a regular pattern; that if the hole is oval it can be ‚Äúaimed‚Äù to sense specific strain directions; and that either by controlling the shape of the hole or its relationship with other holes it can have a tuned response to dynamic strains.We investigate space applications in which novel bio-inspired strain sensors could successfully be used.",TRUE
Biomimicry of bamboo bast fiber with engineering composite materials,"Bamboo, one of the strongest natural structural composite materials, has many distinguishing features. It has been found that its reinforcement unit, hollow, multilayered and spirally-wound bast fiber, plays an extremely important role in its mechanical behavior. In the present work, on the basis of the study on bamboo bast fiber and wood tracheid, a biomimetic model of the reinforcing element, composed of two layers of helically wound fiber, was suggested. To detect the structural characteristics of such a microstructure, four types of macro fiber specimens made of engineering composites were employed: axially aligned solid and hollow cylinders, and single- and double-helical hollow cylinders. These specimens were subjected to several possible loadings, and the experimental results reveal that only the double-helical structural unit possesses the optimum comprehensive mechanical properties. An interlaminar transition zone model imitating bamboo bast fiber was proposed and was verified by engineering composite materials. In our work, the transition zone can increase the interlaminar shear strength of the composite materials by about 15%. These biomimetic structural models can be applied in the design and manufacture of engineering composite materials.",TRUE

Bioprospecting Finds the Toughest Biological Material: Extraordinary Silk from a Giant Riverine Orb Spider,"Background Combining high strength and elasticity, spider silks are exceptionally tough, i.e., able to absorb massive kinetic energy before breaking. Spider silk is therefore a model polymer for development of high performance biomimetic fibers. There are over 41.000 described species of spiders, most spinning multiple types of silk. Thus we have available some 200.000+ unique silks that may cover an amazing breadth of material properties. To date, however, silks from only a few tens of species have been characterized, most chosen haphazardly as model organisms (Nephila) or simply from researchers' backyards. Are we limited to ‚Äòblindly fishing‚Äô in efforts to discover extraordinary silks? Or, could scientists use ecology to predict which species are likely to spin silks exhibiting exceptional performance properties? Methodology We examined the biomechanical properties of silk produced by the remarkable Malagasy ‚ÄòDarwin's bark spider‚Äô (Caerostris darwini), which we predicted would produce exceptional silk based upon its amazing web. The spider constructs its giant orb web (up to 2.8 m2) suspended above streams, rivers, and lakes. It attaches the web to substrates on each riverbank by anchor threads as long as 25 meters. Dragline silk from both Caerostris webs and forcibly pulled silk, exhibits an extraordinary combination of high tensile strength and elasticity previously unknown for spider silk. The toughness of forcibly silked fibers averages 350 MJ/m3, with some samples reaching 520 MJ/m3. Thus, C. darwini silk is more than twice tougher than any previously described silk, and over 10 times better than Kevlar¬Æ. Caerostris capture spiral silk is similarly exceptionally tough. Conclusions Caerostris darwini produces the toughest known biomaterial. We hypothesize that this extraordinary toughness coevolved with the unusual ecology and web architecture of these spiders, decreasing the likelihood of bridgelines breaking and collapsing the web into the river. This hypothesis predicts that rapid change in material properties of silk co-occurred with ecological shifts within the genus, and can thus be tested by combining material science, behavioral observations, and phylogenetics. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of natural history‚Äìinformed bioprospecting to discover silks, as well as other materials, with novel and exceptional properties to serve as models in biomimicry.",TRUE
Biosensing of opioids using frog melanophores,"Spectacular color changes of fishes, frogs and other lower vertebrates are due to the motile activities of specialized pigment containing cells. Pigment cells are interesting for biosensing purposes since they provide an easily monitored physiological phenomenon. Melanophores, containing dark brown melanin pigment granules, constitute an important class of chromatophores. Their melanin-filled pigment granules may be stimulated to undergo rapid dispersion throughout the melanophores (cells appear dark), or aggregation to the center of the melanophores (cells appear light). This simple physiological response can easily be measured in a photometer. Selected G protein coupled receptors can be functionally expressed in cultured frog melanophores. Here, we demonstrate the use of recombinant frog melanophores as a biosensor for the detection of opioids. Melanophores were transfected with the human opioid receptor 3 and used for opiate detection. The response to the opioid receptor agonist morphine and a synthetic opioid peptide was analyzed by absorbance readings in an aggregation assay. It was shown that both agonists caused aggregation of pigment granules in the melanophores, and the cells appeared lighter. The pharmacology of the expressed receptors was very similar to its mammalian counterpart, as evidenced by competitive inhibition by increasing concentrations of the opioid receptor inhibitor naloxone. Transfection of melanophores with selected receptors enables the creation of numerous melanophore biosensors, which respond selectively to certain substances. The melanophore biosensor has potential use for measurement of substances in body fluids such as saliva, blood plasma and urine.",TRUE
Biosynthetic origin of benzoquinones in the explosive discharge of the bombardier beetle Brachinus elongatulus,"Bombardier beetles are well-known for their remarkable defensive mechanism. Their defensive apparatus consists of two compartments known as the reservoir and the reaction chamber. When challenged, muscles surrounding the reservoir contract sending chemical precursors into the reaction chamber where they mix with enzymes resulting in an explosive discharge of a hot noxious chemical spray containing two major quinones: 1,4-benzoquinone and 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (toluquinone). Previously, it has been speculated that the biosynthesis of all benzoquinones originates from one core precursor, 1,4-hydroquinone. Careful ligation of the base of the reservoir chamber enabled us to prevent the explosive reaction and sample untransformed reservoir fluid, which showed that it accumulates significant quantities of 1,4-hydroquinone and 2-methyl-1,4-hydroquinone. We investigated the biosynthetic mechanisms leading to quinone formation by injecting or feeding Brachinus elongatulus beetles with stable-isotope-labeled precursors. Chemical analysis of defensive secretion samples obtained from 1,4-hydroquinone-d6-administered beetles demonstrated that it underwent conversion specifically to 1,4-benzoquinone. Analogously, results from m-cresol-d8 injected or fed beetles confirmed that m-cresol is metabolized to 2-methyl-1,4-hydroquinone, which is then oxidized to 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone in the hot spray. Our results refute the previous claim that 1,4-hydroquinone is the precursor of all substituted benzoquinones in bombardier beetles and reveal that they are biosynthetic products of two independent pathways. Most likely, the aforementioned biosynthetic channel of hydroxylation of appropriate phenolic precursors and subsequent oxidation is not restricted to bombardier beetles; it could well be a general pathway that leads to the formation of all congeners of benzoquinones, one of the most widely distributed groups of defensive compounds in arthropods.

Birch (Betula spp.) leaves adsorb and re-release volatiles specific to neighbouring plants--a mechanism for associational herbivore resistance?,"Plant-emitted semi-volatile compounds have low vaporization rates at 20-25 degrees C and may therefore persist on surfaces such as plant foliage. The passive adsorption of arthropod-repellent semi-volatiles to neighbouring foliage could convey associational resistance, whereby a plant's neighbours reduce damage caused by herbivores. We found that birch (Betula spp.) leaves adsorb and re-release the specific arthropod-repelling C(15) semi-volatiles ledene, ledol and palustrol produced by Rhododendron tomentosum when grown in mixed association in a field setup. In a natural habitat, a higher concentration of ledene was released from birches neighbouring R. tomentosum than from birches situated > 5 m from R. tomentosum. Emission of alpha-humulene, a sesquiterpene synthesized by both Betula pendula and R. tomentosum, was also increased in R. tomentosum-neighbouring B. pendula. In assessments for associational resistance, we found that the polyphagous green leaf weevils (Polydrusus flavipes) and autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) larvae both preferred B. pendula to R. tomentosum. P. flavipes also preferred birch leaves not exposed to R. tomentosum to leaves from mixed associations. In the field, a reduction in Euceraphis betulae aphid density occurred in mixed associations. Our results suggest that plant/tree species may be protected by semi-volatile compounds emitted by a more herbivore-resistant heterospecific neighbour.",TRUE
Bird wings act as a suspension system that rejects gusts,"Musculoskeletal systems cope with many environmental perturbations without neurological control. These passive preflex responses aid animals to move swiftly through complex terrain. Whether preflexes play a substantial role in animal flight is uncertain. We investigated how birds cope with gusty environments and found that their wings can act as a suspension system, reducing the effects of vertical gusts by elevating rapidly about the shoulder. This preflex mechanism rejected the gust impulse through inertial effects, diminishing the predicted impulse to the torso and head by 32% over the first 80 ms, before aerodynamic mechanisms took effect. For each wing, the centre of aerodynamic loading aligns with the centre of percussion, consistent with enhancing passive inertial gust rejection. The reduced motion of the torso in demanding conditions simplifies crucial tasks, such as landing, prey capture and visual tracking. Implementing a similar preflex mechanism in future small-scale aircraft will help to mitigate the effects of gusts and turbulence without added computational burden.",TRUE
Blood Flow to Appendages and the Control of Heat Exchange in American Alligators,"Small American alligators (200-400 g) were heated and cooled from 20 to 35 to 20 C in a temperature-controlled wind tunnel. Blood flow to the limbs and tail was periodically occluded, using remotely controlled occlusion cuffs. When blood flow in all appendages was occluded, the rate of heating was significantly reduced from that when blood flow was unrestricted. The rate of cooling was not significantly affected by occlusion of blood flow in all appendages, however. Blood flow to appendages, rather than a generalized perfusion of the skin, appears to be primarily responsible for the differences in the rates of heating and cooling in alligators.",TRUE

Bone density and the lightweight skeletons of birds,"The skeletons of birds are universally described as lightweight as a result of selection for minimizing the energy required for flight. From a functional perspective, the weight (mass) of an animal relative to its lift-generating surfaces is a key determinant of the metabolic cost of flight. The evolution of birds has been characterized by many weight-saving adaptations that are reflected in bone shape, many of which strengthen and stiffen the skeleton. Although largely unstudied in birds, the material properties of bone tissue can also contribute to bone strength and stiffness. In this study, I calculated the density of the cranium, humerus and femur in passerine birds, rodents and bats by measuring bone mass and volume using helium displacement. I found that, on average, these bones are densest in birds, followed closely by bats. As bone density increases, so do bone stiffness and strength. Both of these optimization criteria are used in the design of strong and stiff, but lightweight, manmade airframes. By analogy, increased bone density in birds and bats may reflect adaptations for maximizing bone strength and stiffness while minimizing bone mass and volume. These data suggest that both bone shape and the material properties of bone tissue have played important roles in the evolution of flight. They also reconcile the conundrum of how bird skeletons can appear to be thin and delicate, yet contribute just as much to total body mass as do the skeletons of terrestrial mammals.",TRUE
Bone-inspired microarchitectures achieve enhanced fatigue life,"Significance Microarchitectured materials, such as foams and lattice structures, can achieve high stiffness and strength while remaining extremely lightweight. Applying high-porosity microarchitectured materials to durable devices, such as vehicles, however, will require the materials to also resist failure during cyclic loading. Here, we identify an aspect of microstructure in cancellous bone that greatly influences failure under cyclic loading and show that the effect is generalizable to synthetic microarchitectured materials. Our findings demonstrate that a common design strategy to improve stiffness and strength of microarchitectured materials comes at the cost of impaired service life. Our findings are useful for the design and application of microarchitectured materials and additionally provide insight into human health in situations of osteoporosis. Microarchitectured materials achieve superior mechanical properties through geometry rather than composition. Although ultralightweight microarchitectured materials can have high stiffness and strength, application to durable devices will require sufficient service life under cyclic loading. Naturally occurring materials provide useful models for high-performance materials. Here, we show that in cancellous bone, a naturally occurring lightweight microarchitectured material, resistance to fatigue failure is sensitive to a microarchitectural trait that has negligible effects on stiffness and strength‚Äîthe proportion of material oriented transverse to applied loads. Using models generated with additive manufacturing, we show that small increases in the thickness of elements oriented transverse to loading can increase fatigue life by 10 to 100 times, far exceeding what is expected from the associated change in density. Transversely oriented struts enhance resistance to fatigue by acting as sacrificial elements. We show that this mechanism is also present in synthetic microlattice structures, where fatigue life can be altered by 5 to 9 times with only negligible changes in density and stiffness. The effects of microstructure on fatigue life in cancellous bone and lattice structures are described empirically by normalizing stress in traditional stress vs. life (S-N) curves by ‚àöœà, where œà is the proportion of material oriented transverse to load. The mechanical performance of cancellous bone and microarchitectured materials is enhanced by aligning structural elements with expected loading; our findings demonstrate that this strategy comes at the cost of reduced fatigue life, with consequences to the use of microarchitectured materials in durable devices and to human health in the context of osteoporosis.",TRUE
Botany: A record-breaking pollen catapult,"The release of stored elastic energy often drives rapid movements in animal systems, and plant components employing this mechanism should be able to move with similar speed.

Both stiff and compliant: morphological and biomechanical adaptations of stick insect antennae for tactile exploration,"Active tactile exploration behaviour is constrained to a large extent by the morphological and biomechanical properties of the animal's somatosensory system. In the model organism Carausius morosus, the main tactile sensory organs are long, thin, seemingly delicate, but very robust antennae. Previous studies have shown that these antennae are compliant under contact, yet stiff enough to maintain a straight shape during active exploration. Overcritical damping of the flagellum, on the other hand, allows for a rapid return to the straight shape after release of contact. Which roles do the morphological and biomechanical adaptations of the flagellum play in determining these special mechanical properties? To investigate this question, we used a combination of biomechanical experiments and numerical modelling. A set of four finite-element (FE) model variants was derived to investigate the effect of the distinct geometrical and material properties of the flagellum on its static (bending) and dynamic (damping) characteristics. The results of our numerical simulations show that the tapered shape of the flagellum had the strongest influence on its static biomechanical behaviour. The annulated structure and thickness gradient affected the deformability of the flagellum to a lesser degree. The inner endocuticle layer of the flagellum was confirmed to be essential for explaining the strongly damped return behaviour of the antenna. By highlighting the significance of two out of the four main structural features of the insect flagellum, our study provides a basis for mechanical design of biomimetic touch sensors tuned to become maximally flexible while quickly resuming a straight shape after contact.",TRUE
Brain Cooling: An Economy Mode of Temperature Regulation in Artiodactyls,"Artiodactyls employ selective brain cooling (SBC) regularly during experimental hyperthermia. In free-ranging antelopes, however, SBC often was present when body temperature was low but absent when brain temperature was near 42 degrees C. The primary effect of SBC is to adjust the activity of the heat loss mechanisms to the magnitude of the heat stress rather than to the protection of the brain from thermal damage.",TRUE
Brilliant angle-independent structural colours preserved in weevil scales from the Swiss Pleistocene,"Extant weevils exhibit a remarkable colour palette that ranges from muted monochromatic tones to rainbow-like iridescence, with the most vibrant colours produced by three-dimensional photonic nanostructures housed within cuticular scales. Although the optical properties of these nanostructures are well understood, their evolutionary history is not fully resolved, in part due to a poor knowledge of their fossil record. Here, we report three-dimensional photonic nanostructures preserved in brightly coloured scales of two weevils, belonging to the genus Phyllobius or Polydrusus, from the Pleistocene (16‚Äì10 ka) of Switzerland. The scales display vibrant blue, green and yellow hues that resemble those of extant Phyllobius/Polydrusus. Scanning electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering analyses reveal that the subfossil scales possess a single-diamond photonic crystal nanostructure. In extant Phyllobius/Polydrusus, the near-angle-independent blue and green hues function primarily in crypsis. The preservation of far-field, angle-independent structural colours in the Swiss subfossil weevils and their likely function in substrate matching confirm the importance of investigating fossil and subfossil photonic nanostructures to understand the evolutionary origins and diversification of colours and associated behaviours (e.g. crypsis) in insects.",TRUE

We report whiteness resulting from a three-dimensional photonic solid in the scales of Cyphochilus spp. beetles. Their scales are characterized by their exceptional whiteness, their perceived brightness, and their optical brilliance, but they are only 5 micrometers thick. This thickness is at least two orders of magnitude thinner than common synthetic systems designed for equivalent-quality whiteness.",TRUE
Bug juice: harvesting electricity with microorganisms,"It is well established that some reduced fermentation products or microbially reduced artificial mediators can abiotically react with electrodes to yield a small electrical current. This type of metabolism does not typically result in an efficient conversion of organic compounds to electricity because only some metabolic end products will react with electrodes, and the microorganisms only incompletely oxidize their organic fuels. A new form of microbial respiration has recently been discovered in which microorganisms conserve energy to support growth by oxidizing organic compounds to carbon dioxide with direct quantitative electron transfer to electrodes. These organisms, termed electricigens, offer the possibility of efficiently converting organic compounds into electricity in self-sustaining systems with long-term stability.",TRUE
Building a home from foam‚Äît√∫ngara frog foam nest architecture and three-phase construction process,"Frogs that build foam nests floating on water face the problems of over-dispersion of the secretions used and eggs being dangerously exposed at the foam : air interface. Nest construction behaviour of t√∫ngara frogs, Engystomops pustulosus, has features that may circumvent these problems. Pairs build nests in periodic bursts of foam production and egg deposition, three discrete phases being discernible. The first is characterized by a bubble raft without egg deposition and an approximately linear increase in duration of mixing events with time. This phase may reduce initial over-dispersion of foam precursor materials until a critical concentration is achieved. The main building phase is marked by mixing events and start-to-start intervals being nearly constant in duration. During the final phase, mixing events do not change in duration but intervals between them increase in an exponential-like fashion. Pairs joining a colonial nesting abbreviate their initial phase, presumably by exploiting a pioneer pair's bubble raft, thereby reducing energy and material expenditure, and time exposed to predators. Finally, eggs are deposited only in the centre of nests with a continuously produced, approximately 1 cm deep egg-free cortex that protectively encloses hatched larvae in stranded nests.",TRUE
Butterfly wing colors: glass scales of Graphium sarpedon cause polarized iridescence and enhance blue/green pigment coloration of the wing membrane,"SUMMARY The wings of the swordtail butterfly Graphium sarpedon nipponum contain the bile pigment sarpedobilin, which causes blue/green colored wing patches. Locally the bile pigment is combined with the strongly blue-absorbing carotenoid lutein, resulting in green wing patches and thus improving camouflage. In the dorsal forewings, the colored patches lack the usual wing scales, but instead have bristles. We have found that on the ventral side most of these patches have very transparent scales that enhance, by reflection, the wing coloration when illuminated from the dorsal side. These glass scales furthermore create a strongly polarized iridescence when illuminated by obliquely incident light from the ventral side, presumably for intraspecific signaling. A few ventral forewing patches have diffusely scattering, white scales that also enhance the blue/green wing coloration when observed from the dorsal side.",TRUE
Calcitic microlenses as part of the photoreceptor system in brittlestars,"Photosensitivity in most echinoderms has been attributed to ‚Äòdiffuse‚Äô dermal receptors. Here we report that certain single calcite crystals used by brittlestars for skeletal construction are also a component of specialized photosensory organs, conceivably with the function of a compound eye. The analysis of arm ossicles in Ophiocoma showed that in light-sensitive species, the periphery of the labyrinthic calcitic skeleton extends into a regular array of spherical microstructures that have a characteristic double-lens design. These structures are absent in light-indifferent species. Photolithographic experiments in which a photoresist film was illuminated through the lens array showed selective exposure of the photoresist under the lens centres. These results provide experimental evidence that the microlenses are optical elements that guide and focus the light inside the tissue. The estimated focal distance (4‚Äì7‚Äâ¬µm below the lenses) coincides with the location of¬†nerve bundles‚Äîthe presumed primary photoreceptors. The lens array is designed to minimize spherical aberration and birefringence and to detect light from a particular direction. The optical performance is further optimized by phototropic chromatophores that regulate the dose of illumination reaching the receptors. These structures represent an example of a multifunctional biomaterial that fulfills both mechanical and optical functions.",TRUE
"Campylobacter jejuni motility integrates specialized cell shape, flagellar filament, and motor, to coordinate action of its opposed flagella","Campylobacter jejuni rotates a flagellum at each pole to swim through the viscous mucosa of its hosts‚Äô gastrointestinal tracts. Despite their importance for host colonization, however, how C. jejuni coordinates rotation of these two opposing flagella is unclear. As well as their polar placement, C. jejuni‚Äôs flagella deviate from the norm of Enterobacteriaceae in other ways: their flagellar motors produce much higher torque and their flagellar filament is made of two different zones of two different flagellins. To understand how C. jejuni‚Äôs opposed motors coordinate, and what contribution these factors play in C. jejuni motility, we developed strains with flagella that could be fluorescently labeled, and observed them by high-speed video microscopy. We found that C. jejuni coordinates its dual flagella by wrapping the leading filament around the cell body during swimming in high-viscosity media and that its differentiated flagellar filament and helical body have evolved to facilitate this wrapped-mode swimming.",TRUE
Capillarity-based switchable adhesion,"Drawing inspiration from the adhesion abilities of a leaf beetle found in nature, we have engineered a switchable adhesion device. The device combines two concepts: The surface tension force from a large number of small liquid bridges can be significant (capillarity-based adhesion) and these contacts can be quickly made or broken with electronic control (switchable). The device grabs or releases a substrate in a fraction of a second via a low-voltage pulse that drives electroosmotic flow. Energy consumption is minimal because both the grabbed and released states are stable equilibria that persist with no energy added to the system. Notably, the device maintains the integrity of an array of hundreds to thousands of distinct interfaces during active reconfiguration from droplets to bridges and back, despite the natural tendency of the liquid toward coalescence. We demonstrate the scaling of adhesion strength with the inverse of liquid contact size. This suggests that strengths approaching those of permanent bonding adhesives are possible as feature size is scaled down. In addition, controllability is fast and efficient because the attachment time and required voltage also scale down favorably. The device features compact size, no solid moving parts, and is made of common materials.",TRUE
Carbon acquisition by diatoms,"Diatoms are responsible for up to 40% of primary productivity in the ocean, and complete genome sequences are available for two species. However, there are very significant gaps in our understanding of how diatoms take up and assimilate inorganic C. Diatom plastids originate from secondary endosymbiosis with a red alga and their Form ID Rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase) from horizontal gene transfer, which means that embryophyte paradigms can only give general guidance as to their C acquisition mechanisms. Although diatom Rubiscos have relatively high CO(2) affinity and CO(2)/O(2) selectivity, the low diffusion coefficient for CO(2) in water has the potential to restrict the rate of photosynthesis. Diatoms growing in their natural aquatic habitats operate inorganic C concentrating mechanisms (CCMs), which provide a steady-state CO(2) concentration around Rubisco higher than that in the medium. How these CCMs work is still a matter of debate. However, it is known that both CO(2) and HCO (3) (-) are taken up, and an obvious but as yet unproven possibility is that active transport of these species across the plasmalemma and/or the four-membrane plastid envelope is the basis of the CCM. In one marine diatom there is evidence of C(4)-like biochemistry which could act as, or be part of, a CCM. Alternative mechanisms which have not been eliminated include the production of CO(2) from HCO (3) (-) at low pH maintained by a H(+) pump, in a compartment close to that containing Rubisco.",TRUE
Carbon storage in US wetlands,"Wetland soils contain some of the highest stores of soil carbon in the biosphere. However, there is little understanding of the quantity and distribution of carbon stored in our remaining wetlands or of the potential effects of human disturbance on these stocks. Here we use field data from the 2011 National Wetland Condition Assessment to provide unbiased estimates of soil carbon stocks for wetlands at regional and national scales. We find that wetlands in the conterminous United States store a total of 11.52‚ÄâPgC, much of which is within soils deeper than 30‚Äâcm. Freshwater inland wetlands, in part due to their substantial areal extent, hold nearly ten-fold more carbon than tidal saltwater sites‚Äîindicating their importance in regional carbon storage. Our data suggest a possible relationship between carbon stocks and anthropogenic disturbance. These data highlight the need to protect wetlands to mitigate the risk of avoidable contributions to climate change.",TRUE
Carotenoid fluorescence in Dunaliella salina,"Dunaliella salina is a halotolerant green alga that is well known for its carotenoid producing capacity. The produced carotenoids are mainly stored in lipid globules. For various research purposes, such as production and extraction kinetics, we would like to determine and/or localise the carotenoid globules in vivo. In this study, we show that the carotenoid-rich globules emit clear green fluorescence, which can be used in, for example, fluorescence microscopy (e.g. CLSM) to obtain pictures of the cells and their carotenoid content.",TRUE
Carotenoids need structural colours to shine,"The bright colours of feathers are among the most striking displays in nature and are frequently used as sexual signals. Feathers can be coloured by pigments or by ordered tissue, and these mechanisms have traditionally been treated as distinct modes of display. Here we show that some yellow plumage colour is created both by reflection of light from white structural tissue and absorption of light by carotenoids. Thus, structural components of feathers contribute substantially to yellow ‚Äòcarotenoid‚Äô displays, but the effect of variation in structural components on variation in colour displays is, to our knowledge, unstudied. The presence of structural colour in some carotenoid-based colour displays will have to be considered in studies of colour signalling.",TRUE
Carrion-feeding on the sediment surface at nocturnal low tides by the polychaete Phyllodoce mucosa,"Harsh physical conditions in the intertidal zone are the cause of an ample amount of dead macroinvertebrates, which constitute a food source for carrion-feeders. In the European Wadden Sea, this trophic guild includes decapod crustaceans and fish when the tide is in, while during nocturnal low tides the polychaete Phyllodoce mucosa is attracted in large numbers by dead mollusks, crabs or worms on the sediment surface. Within 10¬†s worms emerged to the surface, crawled as far as 15¬†m on mucus trails towards the carcass, sucked in tissue up to one-third of their own weight, and then quickly retreated to below the surface. Abundance of P. mucosa was highest in the lower intertidal zone and winter. The seaward high abundance pattern, however, did not continue into the shallow subtidal. In summer, few were attracted during daytime or when the tide was in. However, up to 447 worms aggregated at a single crushed mussel within 20¬†min at dusk during low-tide exposure. This study suggests that during winter carrion-feeding is an important trophic niche on cold-temperate, intertidal mud flats occupied by a phyllodocid polychaete that is segregated in feeding time from most other scavengers and benefits from cold-sensitive benthic invertebrates.",TRUE
Cartilage aggrecan can undergo self-adhesion.,"Here it is reported that aggrecan, the highly negatively charged macromolecule in the cartilage extracellular matrix, undergoes Ca(2+)-mediated self-adhesion after static compression even in the presence of strong electrostatic repulsion in physiological-like solution conditions. Aggrecan was chemically end-attached onto gold-coated planar silicon substrates and gold-coated microspherical atomic force microscope probe tips (end radius R approximately 2.5 mum) at a density ( approximately 40 mg/mL) that simulates physiological conditions in the tissue ( approximately 20-80 mg/mL). Colloidal force spectroscopy was employed to measure the adhesion between opposing aggrecan monolayers in NaCl (0.001-1.0 M) and NaCl + CaCl(2) ([Cl(-)] = 0.15 M, [Ca(2+)] = 0 - 75 mM) aqueous electrolyte solutions. Aggrecan self-adhesion was found to increase with increasing surface equilibration time upon compression (0-30 s). Hydrogen bonding and physical entanglements between the chondroitin sulfate-glycosaminoglycan side chains are proposed as important factors contributing to aggrecan self-adhesion. Self-adhesion was found to significantly increase with decreasing bath ionic strength (and hence, electrostatic double-layer repulsion), as well as increasing Ca(2+) concentration due to the additional ion-bridging effects. It is hypothesized that aggrecan self-adhesion, and the macromolecular energy dissipation that results from this self-adhesion, could be important factors contributing to the self-assembled architecture and integrity of the cartilage extracellular matrix in vivo.",TRUE
Catapulting Tentacles in a Sticky Carnivorous Plant,"Among trapping mechanisms in carnivorous plants, those termed ‚Äòactive‚Äô have especially fascinated scientists since Charles Darwin‚Äôs early works because trap movements are involved. Fast snap-trapping and suction of prey are two of the most spectacular examples for how these plants actively catch animals, mainly arthropods, for a substantial nutrient supply. We show that Drosera glanduligera, a sundew from southern Australia, features a sophisticated catapult mechanism: Prey animals walking near the edge of the sundew trigger a touch-sensitive snap-tentacle, which swiftly catapults them onto adjacent sticky glue-tentacles; the insects are then slowly drawn within the concave trap leaf by sticky tentacles. This is the first detailed documentation and analysis of such catapult-flypaper traps in action and highlights a unique and surprisingly complex mechanical adaptation to carnivory.",TRUE
Causes and Consequences of Fluctuating Coelomic Pressure in Sea Urchins.,"We measured coelomic pressure in sea urchins to determine whether it was high enough to support a pneu hypothesis of growth. In Strongylocentrotus purpuratus the pressure was found to fluctuate rhythmically about a mean of -8 Pa, and was negative for 70% of the time. This is at variance with the theoretically required positive pressures of the pneu hypothesis. Furthermore, there were no sustained significant differences between the pressure patterns of fed and starved urchins, presumed to be growing and not growing, respectively. The rhythmical fluctuations in pressure were caused by movements of the lantern which changed the curvature and tension of the peristomial membrane. We developed a mathematical and morphological model relating lantern movements, membrane tension, and pressure, that correctly predicts the magnitude of the fluctuations. Pressures predicted by the model depend also on coelomic volume changes. In Lytechinus variegatus simultaneous retraction of the podia, which causes expansion of the ampullae, resulted in an 8.8 Pa increase in coelomic pressure, relative to the pressure during simultaneous podial protraction.",TRUE
Cell-derived stiffening and plasticizing factors in sea cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa) dermis,"The stiffness of holothurian dermis can be altered experimentally in vitro by changing the concentration of extracellular Ca(2+). Previous experiments with Cucumaria frondosa have established that these Ca(2+) effects are due to Ca(2+)-dependent cellular processes rather than to direct effects of Ca(2+) on the extracellular matrix. The present report describes two protein factors that are released from cells of C. frondosa dermis by membrane lysis and that directly alter the stiffness of the extracellular matrix. One factor, isolated from the inner dermis, increased tissue stiffness in the absence of Ca(2+). The second factor, from the outer dermis, decreased tissue stiffness in the presence of normal Ca(2+) levels. The relative abundance of these two factors in the inner and outer dermis suggests the possibility that the cells that control tissue stiffness are spatially segregated. Both factors were partially purified under non-denaturing conditions by anion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. The partially purified protein preparations retained biological activity. These results suggest that the stiffness of sea cucumber dermis is regulated by cell-mediated secretion of either the stiffening or plasticizing protein and that alterations in dermis stiffness brought about by manipulation of Ca(2+) levels are mediated by effects on secretion of one or both of these proteins.",TRUE
Cellular and Molecular Biology of the Aquaporin Water Channels,"The high water permeability characteristic of mammalian red cell membranes is now known to be caused by the protein AQP1. This channel freely permits movement of water across the cell membrane, but it is not permeated by other small, uncharged molecules or charged solutes. AQP1 is a tetramer with each subunit containing an aqueous pore likened to an hourglass formed by obversely arranged tandem repeats. Cryoelectron microscopy of reconstituted AQP1 membrane crystals has revealed the three-dimensional structure at 3‚Äì6 √Ö. AQP1 is distributed in apical and basolateral membranes of renal proximal tubules and descending thin limbs as well as capillary endothelia. Ten mammalian aquaporins have been identified in water-permeable tissues and fall into two groupings. Orthodox aquaporins are water-selective and include AQP2, a vasopressin-regulated water channel in renal collecting duct, in addition to AQP0, AQP4, and AQP5. Multifunctional aquaglyceroporins AQP3, AQP7, and AQP9 are permeated by water, glycerol, and some other solutes. Aquaporins are being defined in numerous other species including amphibia, insects, plants, and microbials. Members of the aquaporin family are implicated in numerous physiological processes as well as the pathophysiology of a wide range of clinical disorders.",TRUE

Cercosporamide inhibits bone morphogenetic protein receptor type I kinase activity in zebrafish,"ABSTRACT Zebrafish models are well-established tools for investigating the underlying mechanisms of diseases. Here, we identified cercosporamide, a metabolite from the fungus Ascochyta aquiliqiae, as a potent bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR) type I kinase inhibitor through a zebrafish embryo phenotypic screen. The developmental defects in zebrafish, including lack of the ventral fin, induced by cercosporamide were strikingly similar to the phenotypes caused by renowned small-molecule BMPR type I kinase inhibitors and inactivating mutations in zebrafish BMPRs. In mammalian cell-based assays, cercosporamide blocked BMP/SMAD-dependent transcriptional reporter activity and BMP-induced SMAD1/5-phosphorylation. Biochemical assays with a panel of purified recombinant kinases demonstrated that cercosporamide directly inhibited kinase activity of type I BMPRs [also called activin receptor-like kinases (ALKs)]. In mammalian cells, cercosporamide selectively inhibited constitutively active BMPR type I-induced SMAD1/5 phosphorylation. Importantly, cercosporamide rescued the developmental defects caused by constitutively active Alk2 in zebrafish embryos. We believe that cercosporamide could be the first of a new class of molecules with potential to be developed further for clinical use against diseases that are causally linked to overactivation of BMPR signaling, including fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper. Summary: Cercosporamide, a metabolite from the fungus Ascochyta aquiliqiae, was identified as a potent bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR) type I kinase inhibitor through a zebrafish embryo phenotypic screen.",TRUE
Chameleons have independent eye movements but synchronise both eyes during saccadic prey tracking,"Abstract. The movements of both eyes and the head were recorded with search coils in unrestrained, freely moving chameleons. As a main result I found that the generation of saccades in the left and the right eye was either independent from each other or was highly correlated according to the behavioural situation. When no prey item was fixated, disconjugate saccades were observed which was in accordance with earlier observations in chameleons. During prey tracking the chameleons switched to a different oculomotor behaviour and pursued the moving prey with synchronous saccades. At higher target velocities, the tracking movement of the head was also saccadic and was synchronised with the two eyes. Binocular coupling affected only the timing of the saccades but not the metrics: the amplitudes of the synchronous saccades were usually different in the two eyes. These observations suggest the existence of two independent premotor neuronal circuits for left and right eye saccadic motor control in the chameleon. Binocular coupling in prey-tracking chameleons is probably achieved by neuronal coupling of these premotor circuits during eye‚Äìhead coordination. The ability to switch between synchronous and uncoupled saccadic eye movements has not been described for any other vertebrate. This unique ability of the chameleon may help to understand the organisation of the oculomotor system of other vertebrates since evidence for separate left eye and right eye saccade generation and position control has recently also been reported in primates.",TRUE

Character Displacement Promotes Cooperation in Bacterial Biofilms,"Resource competition within a group of cooperators is expected to decrease selection for cooperative behavior but can also result in diversifying selection for the use of different resources, which in turn could retard the breakdown of cooperation. Diverse groups are likely to be less susceptible to invasion by noncooperating social cheats: First, competition repression resulting from character displacement may provide less of a selective advantage to cheating; second, cheats may trade off the ability to exploit cooperators that specialize in one type of resource against cooperators that specialize in another ; third, diverse communities of any kind may have higher invasion resistance because there are fewer resources available for an invader to use . Furthermore, diverse groups are likely to be more productive than clonal groups if a wider range of total resources are being used . We addressed these issues by using the cooperative trait of biofilm formation in Pseudomonas fluorescens. Character displacement through resource competition evolved within biofilms; productivity increased with increasing character displacement, and diverse biofilms were less susceptible to invasion by cheats. These results demonstrate that diversification into different ecological niches can minimize selection against cooperation in the face of local resource competition.",TRUE
Characterization of an electron conduit between bacteria and the extracellular environment,"A number of species of Gram-negative bacteria can use insoluble minerals of Fe(III) and Mn(IV) as extracellular respiratory electron acceptors. In some species of Shewanella, deca-heme electron transfer proteins lie at the extracellular face of the outer membrane (OM), where they can interact with insoluble substrates. To reduce extracellular substrates, these redox proteins must be charged by the inner membrane/periplasmic electron transfer system. Here, we present a spectro-potentiometric characterization of a trans-OM icosa-heme complex, MtrCAB, and demonstrate its capacity to move electrons across a lipid bilayer after incorporation into proteoliposomes. We also show that a stable MtrAB subcomplex can assemble in the absence of MtrC; an MtrBC subcomplex is not assembled in the absence of MtrA; and MtrA is only associated to the membrane in cells when MtrB is present. We propose a model for the modular organization of the MtrCAB complex in which MtrC is an extracellular element that mediates electron transfer to extracellular substrates and MtrB is a trans-OM spanning Œ≤-barrel protein that serves as a sheath, within which MtrA and MtrC exchange electrons. We have identified the MtrAB module in a range of bacterial phyla, suggesting that it is widely used in electron exchange with the extracellular environment.",TRUE
Characterization of mechanisms for Ca2+ and HCO3‚Äì/CO32‚Äì acquisition for shell formation in embryos of the freshwater common pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis,"SUMMARY The freshwater common pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis produces embryos that complete direct development, hatching as shell-bearing individuals within 10 days despite relatively low ambient calcium and carbonate availability. This development is impaired by removal of ambient total calcium but not by removal of bicarbonate and/or carbonate. In this study we utilized pharmacological agents to target possible acquisition pathways for both Ca2+ and accumulation of carbonate in post-metamorphic, shell-laying embryos. Using whole egg mass flux measurements and ion-specific microelectrode analytical techniques, we have demonstrated that carbonic anhydrase-catalyzed hydration of CO2 is central in the acquisition of both shell-forming ions because it provides the hydrogen ions for an electrogenic vacuolar-type H+-ATPase that fuels the uptake of Ca2+ via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and possibly an electrogenic Ca2+/1H+ exchanger. Additionally, CO2 hydration provides an endogenous source of HCO ‚Äì3. Thus, hydration of endogenous CO2 forms HCO ‚Äì3 for calcification while hydrogen ions are excreted, contributing to continued Ca2+ uptake, as well as creating favorable alkaline internal conditions for calcification. The connections between Ca2+ and HCO ‚Äì3 acquisition mechanisms that we describe here provide new insight into this efficient, embryonic calcification in freshwater.",TRUE
Charging the batteries to heal wounds through PI3K,"Endogenous electric fields in wounds have been documented for centuries, but they have received little attention from the scientific community.

Chromatic neuronal jamming in a primitive brain,"Jamming models developed in inanimate matter have been widely used to describe cell packing in tissues 1 ‚Äì 7 , but predominantly neglect cell diversity, despite its prevalence in biology. Most tissues, animal brains in particular, comprise a mix of many cell types, with mounting evidence suggesting that neurons can recognize their respective types as they organize in space 8 ‚Äì 11 . How cell diversity revises the current jamming paradigm is unknown. Here, in the brain of the flatworm planarian Schmidtea mediterranea , which exhibits remarkable tissue plasticity within a simple, quantifiable nervous system 12 ‚Äì 16 , we identify a distinct packing state, ‚Äòchromatic‚Äô jamming. Combining experiments with computational modelling, we show that neurons of distinct types form independent percolating networks barring any physical contact. This jammed state emerges as cell packing configurations become constrained by cell type-specific interactions and therefore may extend to describe cell packing in similarly complex tissues composed of multiple cell types. An imaging study of planarian flatworm brains demonstrates that densely packed neural tissues seem to have packing configurations commensurate with a jammed state.",TRUE
Circumferential spicule growth by pericellular silica deposition in the hexactinellid sponge Monorhaphis chuni,"SUMMARY The giant basal spicule of the hexactinellid sponge Monorhaphis chuni represents the longest natural siliceous structure on Earth. This spicule is composed of concentrically arranged lamellae that are approximately 10 Œºm thick. In the present study, we investigated the formation of outer lamellae on a cellular level using microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. It is shown that the formation of an outermost lamella begins with the association of cell clusters with the surface of the thickening and/or growing spicule. The cells release silica for controlled formation of a lamella. The pericellular (silica) material fuses to a delimited and textured layer of silica with depressions approximately 20‚Äì30 Œºm in diameter. The newly formed layer initially displays 40 Œºm wide, well-structured banded ribbons and only attains its plain surface in a final step. The chemical composition in the depressions was studied using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and by staining with Texas Red. The data suggest that those depressions are the nests for the silica-forming cells and that silica formation starts with a direct association of silica-forming cells with the outer surface of the spicule, where they remain and initiate the development of the next lamellae.",TRUE
Cleaving C-Hg bonds: two thiolates are better than one,"Organomercurial lyase (MerB) catalyzes the difficult cleavage of C-Hg bonds to hydrocarbon and mercuric dithiol products.

Click communication in wild harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena),"Social delphinids employ a vocal repertoire of clicks for echolocation and whistles for communication. Conversely, the less social and acoustically cryptic harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) only produce narrow-band high-frequency (NBHF) clicks with properties that appear poorly suited for communication. Nevertheless, these small odontocetes likely mediate social interactions, such as mate choice and mother-calf contact, with sound. Here, we deployed six tags (DTAG3) on wild porpoises in Danish waters for a total of 96‚Äâhours to investigate if the patterns and use of stereotyped NBHF click trains are consistent with a communication function. We show that wild porpoises produce frequent (up to 27 $$\bullet $$‚àô min‚àí1), high-repetition rate click series with repetition rates and output levels different from those of foraging buzzes. These sounds are produced in bouts and frequently co-occur with emission of similar sounds by nearby conspecifics, audible on the tags for >10% of the time. These results suggest that social interactions are more important to this species than their limited social encounters at the surface may indicate and that these interactions are mediated by at least two broad categories of calls composed of short, high-repetition rate click trains that may encode information via the repetition rate of their stereotyped NBHF clicks.",TRUE
"Cloning, characterization and expression of escapin, a broadly antimicrobial FAD-containing l-amino acid oxidase from ink of the sea hare Aplysia californica","SUMMARY A 60 kDa monomeric protein isolated from the defensive purple ink secretion of the sea hare Aplysia californica was cloned and sequenced, and is the first sea hare antimicrobial protein to be functionally expressed in E. coli. Sequence analysis suggested that this protein is a flavin-containing l-amino acid oxidase (LAAO), with one predicted potential glycosylation site, although the glycosylation could not be experimentally confirmed. This protein, which we call `escapin', has high sequence similarity to several other gastropod proteins. Escapin was verified by NMR, mass spectroscopy and HPLC to have FAD as its flavin cofactor. Escapin's antimicrobial effects, bacteriostasis and bactericidal, were determined using a combination of two assays: (1) incubation of bacteria on solid media followed by assessment of inhibition by direct observation of zones of inhibition or by turbidity measurements; and (2) incubation of bacteria in liquid media followed by counting viable colonies after growing on agar plates. Native escapin inhibited the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including marine bacteria (Vibrio harveyii and Staphylococcus aureus) and pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Escapin also inhibited the growth of yeast and fungi, with different efficacies. Escapin's antimicrobial activity was concentration dependent and did not decrease when stored for more than 5 months at room temperature. Escapin was bacteriostatic and not bactericidal in minimal media (e.g. salt media) with glucose, yeast extract, and a mixture of 20 amino acids each at 50 Œºmol l-1, but was bactericidal in media enriched with Tryptone Peptone. Escapin was also strongly bactericidal in media with l-lysine at concentrations as low as 3 mmol l-1 and slightly bactericidal in 50 mmol l-1 l-arginine, but not in most other amino acids even at 50 mmol l-1. Escapin had high oxidase activity (producing hydrogen peroxide) with either l-arginine or l-lysine as a substrate and little to no oxidase activity with other l-amino acids. Hydrogen peroxide alone (without escapin or amino acids) was strongly bacteriostatic but poorly bactericidal, similar in this respect to l-arginine but different from l-lysine in the presence of escapin. Together these results suggest that there are multiple mechanisms to escapin's antimicrobial effects, with bacteriostasis resulting largely or entirely from the effects of hydrogen peroxide produced by escapin's LAAO activity, but bactericidal effects resulting from lysine-dependent mechanisms not directly involving hydrogen peroxide. Recombinant escapin expressed in bacteria was also active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, suggesting that glycosylation is not essential for antimicrobial activity.",TRUE
Cnidocyte mechanoreceptors are tuned to the movements of swimming prey by chemoreceptors.,"Cnidocytes, the stinging cells of cnidarians, discharge nematocysts in response to physical contact accompanied by the stimulation of specific chemoreceptors. Cnidocytes in fishing tentacles of a sea anemone are now found to discharge nematocysts preferentially into targets vibrating at 30, 55, and 65 to 75 hertz. Moreover, in the presence of submicromolar concentrations of known chemosensitizers, such as N-acetylated sugars and mucin, these optima shift to 5, 15, 30, and 40 hertz, frequencies that correspond to the movements of swimming prey. Hence, chemoreceptors for these substances tune cnidocyte mechanoreceptors to frequencies that match the movements of the prey.",TRUE
Cold-blooded snipers: thermal independence of ballistic tongue projection in the salamander Hydromantes platycephalus.,"Plethodontid salamanders of the genus Hydromantes capture prey using the most extreme tongue projection among salamanders, and can shoot the tongue a distance of 80% of body length in less than 20‚Äâmsec. The tongue skeleton is projected from the body via an elastic-recoil mechanism that decouples muscle contraction from tongue projection, amplifying muscle power tenfold. We tested the hypothesis that the elastic-recoil mechanism also endows tongue projection with low thermal dependence by examining the kinematics and dynamics of tongue projection in Hydromantes platycephalus over a range of body temperatures (2-24¬∞C). We found that H. platycephalus maintained tongue-projection performance over the tested temperature range and that tongue projection showed thermal independence (Q(10) values of 0.94-1.04) of all performance parameters including projection distance, average velocity, and peak instantaneous values of velocity, acceleration, and power. Nonelastic, muscle-powered tongue retraction, in contrast, responded to temperature changes significantly differently than elastic tongue projection; performance parameters of retraction displayed thermal dependence typical of muscle-powered movement (Q(10) values of 1.63-4.97). These results reveal that the elastic-recoil mechanism liberates tongue projection from the effects of temperature on muscle contractile rates. We suggest that relative thermal independence is a general characteristic of elastic-recoil mechanisms and may promote the evolution of these mechanisms in ectothermic animals.",TRUE
Cold-stable eye lens crystallins of the Antarctic nototheniid toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni Norman,"SUMMARY The eye lenses of the Antarctic nototheniid fishes that inhabit the perennially freezing Antarctic seawater are transparent at ‚Äì2¬∞C, whereas the cold-sensitive mammalian and tropical fish lenses display cold-induced cataract at 20¬∞C and 7¬∞C, respectively. No cold-cataract occurs in the giant Antarctic toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni lens when cooled to temperatures as low as ‚Äì12¬∞C, indicating highly cold-stable lens proteins. To investigate this cold stability, we characterised the lens crystallin proteins of the Antarctic toothfish, in parallel with those of the sub-tropical bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus and the endothermic cow Bos taurus, representing three disparate thermal climes (‚Äì2¬∞C, 18¬∞C and 37¬∞C, respectively). Sizing chromatography resolved their lens crystallins into three groups,Œ± /Œ≤H, Œ≤ and Œ≥, with Œ≥ crystallins being the most abundant (>40%) lens proteins in fish, in contrast to the cow lens where they comprise only 19%. The upper thermal stability of these crystallin components correlated with the body temperature of the species. In vitro chaperone assays showed that fish Œ± crystallin can protect same-species Œ≥ crystallins from heat denaturation, as well as lysozyme from DTT-induced unfolding, and therefore are small Heat Shock Proteins (sHSP) like their mammalian counterparts. Dynamic light scattering measured an increase in size of Œ±Œ≥ crystallin mixtures upon heating, which supports formation of the Œ±Œ≥ complex as an integral part of the chaperone process. Surprisingly, in cross-species chaperone assays, tunaŒ± crystallins only partly protected toothfish Œ≥ crystallins, while cow Œ± crystallins completely failed to protect, indicating partial and no Œ±Œ≥ interaction, respectively. Toothfish Œ≥ was likely to be the component that failed to interact, as the supernatant from a cowŒ± plus toothfish Œ≥ incubation could chaperone cow Œ≥ crystallins in a subsequent heat incubation, indicating the presence of uncomplexed cow Œ±. This suggests that the inability of toothfish Œ≥ crystallins to fully complex with tuna Œ±, and not at all with the cowŒ± crystallins, may have its basis in adaptive changes in the protein that relate to the extreme cold-stability of the toothfish lens.",TRUE
Collective Computation in Animal Fission-Fusion Dynamics,"Recent work suggests that collective computation of social structure can minimize uncertainty about the social and physical environment, facilitating adaptation. We explore these ideas by studying how fission-fusion social structure arises in spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) groups, exploring whether monkeys use social knowledge to collectively compute subgroup size distributions adaptive for foraging in variable environments. We assess whether individual decisions to stay in or leave subgroups are conditioned on strategies based on the presence or absence of others. We search for this evidence in a time series of subgroup membership. We find that individuals have multiple strategies, suggesting that the social knowledge of different individuals is important. These stay-leave strategies provide microscopic inputs to a stochastic model of collective computation encoded in a family of circuits. Each circuit represents an hypothesis for how collectives combine strategies to make decisions, and how these produce various subgroup size distributions. By running these circuits forward in simulation we generate new subgroup size distributions and measure how well they match food abundance in the environment using transfer entropies. We find that spider monkeys decide to stay or go using information from multiple individuals and that they can collectively compute a distribution of subgroup size that makes efficient use of ephemeral sources of nutrition. We are able to artificially tune circuits with subgroup size distributions that are a better fit to the environment than the observed. This suggests that a combination of measurement error, constraint, and adaptive lag are diminishing the power of collective computation in this system. These results are relevant for a more general understanding of the emergence of ordered states in multi-scale social systems with adaptive properties‚Äìboth natural and engineered.",TRUE
Collective decision making and social interaction rules in mixed-species flocks of songbirds,"Associations in mixed-species foraging groups are common in animals, yet have rarely been explored in the context of collective behaviour. Despite many investigations into the social and ecological conditions under which individuals should form groups, we still know little about the specific behavioural rules that individuals adopt in these contexts, or whether these can be generalized to heterospecifics. Here, we studied collective behaviour in flocks in a community of five species of woodland passerine birds. We adopted an automated data collection protocol, involving visits by RFID-tagged birds to feeding stations equipped with antennae, over two winters, recording 91‚Äà576 feeding events by 1904 individuals. We demonstrated highly synchronized feeding behaviour within patches, with birds moving towards areas of the patch with the largest proportion of the flock. Using a model of collective decision making, we then explored the underlying decision rule birds may be using when foraging in mixed-species flocks. The model tested whether birds used a different decision rule for conspecifics and heterospecifics, and whether the rules used by individuals of different species varied. We found that species differed in their response to the distribution of conspecifics and heterospecifics across foraging patches. However, simulating decisions using the different rules, which reproduced our data well, suggested that the outcome of using different decision rules by each species resulted in qualitatively similar overall patterns of movement. It is possible that the decision rules each species uses may be adjusted to variation in mean species abundance in order for individuals to maintain the same overall flock-level response. This is likely to be important for maintaining coordinated behaviour across species, and to result in quick and adaptive flock responses to food resources that are patchily distributed in space and time.",TRUE
Collective ventilation in honeybee nests,"European honey bees (Apis mellifera) live in large congested nest cavities with a single opening that limits passive ventilation. When the local air temperature exceeds a threshold, the nests are actively ventilated by bees fanning their wings at the nest entrance. Here, we show that colonies with relatively large nest entrances use an emergent ventilation strategy where fanning bees self-organize to form groups, separating regions of continuous inflow and outflow. The observed spatio-temporal patterns correlate the air velocity and air temperature along the entrances to the distribution of fanning bees. A mathematical model that couples these variables to known fanning behaviour of individuals recapitulates their collective dynamics. Additionally, the model makes predictions about the temporal stability of the fanning group as a function of the temperature difference between the environment and the nest. Consistent with these predictions, we observe that the fanning groups drift, cling to the entrance boundaries, break-up and reform as the ambient temperature varies over a period of days. Overall, our study shows how honeybees use flow-mediated communication to self-organize into a steady state in fluctuating environments.",TRUE
Collenchyma: a versatile mechanical tissue with dynamic cell walls.,"BACKGROUNDCollenchyma has remained in the shadow of commercially exploited mechanical tissues such as wood and fibres, and therefore has received little attention since it was first described. However, collenchyma is highly dynamic, especially compared with sclerenchyma. It is the main supporting tissue of growing organs with walls thickening during and after elongation. In older organs, collenchyma may become more rigid due to changes in cell wall composition or may undergo sclerification through lignification of newly deposited cell wall material. While much is known about the systematic and organographic distribution of collenchyma, there is rather less information regarding the molecular architecture and properties of its cell walls.SCOPE AND CONCLUSIONSThis review summarizes several aspects that have not previously been extensively discussed including the origin of the term 'collenchyma' and the history of its typology. As the cell walls of collenchyma largely determine the dynamic characteristics of this tissue, I summarize the current state of knowledge regarding their structure and molecular composition. Unfortunately, to date, detailed studies specifically focusing on collenchyma cell walls have not been undertaken. However, generating a more detailed understanding of the structural and compositional modifications associated with the transition from plastic to elastic collenchyma cell wall properties is likely to provide significant insights into how specific configurations of cell wall polymers result in specific functional properties. This approach, focusing on architecture and functional properties, is likely to provide improved clarity on the controversial definition of collenchyma.",TRUE
Colour-producing Œ≤-keratin nanofibres in blue penguin (Eudyptula minor) feathers,"The colours of living organisms are produced by the differential absorption of light by pigments (e.g. carotenoids, melanins) and/or by the physical interactions of light with biological nanostructures, referred to as structural colours. Only two fundamental morphologies of non-iridescent nanostructures are known in feathers, and recent work has proposed that they self-assemble by intracellular phase separation processes. Here, we report a new biophotonic nanostructure in the non-iridescent blue feather barbs of blue penguins (Eudyptula minor) composed of parallel Œ≤-keratin nanofibres organized into densely packed bundles. Synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering and two-dimensional Fourier analysis of electron micrographs of the barb nanostructure revealed short-range order in the organization of fibres at the appropriate size scale needed to produce the observed colour by coherent scattering. These two-dimensional quasi-ordered penguin nanostructures are convergent with similar arrays of parallel collagen fibres in avian and mammalian skin, but constitute a novel morphology for feathers. The identification of a new class of Œ≤-keratin nanostructures adds significantly to the known mechanisms of colour production in birds and suggests additional complexity in their self-assembly.",TRUE
Colourful parrot feathers resist bacterial degradation,"The brilliant red, orange and yellow colours of parrot feathers are the product of psittacofulvins, which are synthetic pigments known only from parrots. Recent evidence suggests that some pigments in bird feathers function not just as colour generators, but also preserve plumage integrity by increasing the resistance of feather keratin to bacterial degradation. We exposed a variety of colourful parrot feathers to feather-degrading Bacillus licheniformis and found that feathers with red psittacofulvins degraded at about the same rate as those with melanin and more slowly than white feathers, which lack pigments. Blue feathers, in which colour is based on the microstructural arrangement of keratin, air and melanin granules, and green feathers, which combine structural blue with yellow psittacofulvins, degraded at a rate similar to that of red and black feathers. These differences in resistance to bacterial degradation of differently coloured feathers suggest that colour patterns within the Psittaciformes may have evolved to resist bacterial degradation, in addition to their role in communication and camouflage.",TRUE
Communication versus waterproofing: the physics of insect cuticular hydrocarbons,"ABSTRACT Understanding the evolution of complex traits is among the major challenges in biology. One such trait is the cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) layer in insects. It protects against desiccation and provides communication signals, especially in social insects. CHC composition is highly diverse within and across species. To understand the adaptive value of this chemical diversity, we must understand how it affects biological functionality. So far, CHCs have received ample research attention, but their physical properties were little studied. We argue that these properties determine their biological functionality, and are vital to understanding how CHC composition affects their adaptive value. We investigated melting behaviour and viscosity of CHCs from 11 ant species using differential scanning calorimetry and a novel microrheological technique. CHCs began melting below ‚àí45¬∞C, and often were entirely liquid only above 30¬∞C. Thus, they formed a solid‚Äìliquid mixture under ambient conditions, which contrasts to previous assumptions of entirely solid layers in many species. This may be adaptive as only biphasic CHC layers ensure uniform coating of the insect body, which is necessary for waterproofing. CHC viscosity was mostly between 0.1 and 0.2‚ÄÖPa‚ÄÖs‚àí1, thus similar to motor oils. Surprisingly, chemically different CHC profiles had similar viscosities, suggesting that a certain viscosity level is adaptive and ensures that communication signals can be perceived. With this study, we draw attention to the importance of studying the physics of CHC layers. Only by understanding how chemical and physical mechanisms enable CHC functionality can we understand the causes and consequences of CHC diversification. Summary: Cuticular hydrocarbons protect insects from desiccation and allow chemical communication, and contain both liquid and solid parts. This complex phase behaviour appears vital to ensure biological functioning.",TRUE
Compact nanoscale textures reduce contact time of bouncing droplets,"Compact nanoscale textures reduce contact time of bouncing droplets with implications in insect survival and miniature drones. Many natural surfaces are capable of rapidly shedding water droplets‚Äîa phenomenon that has been attributed to the presence of low solid fraction textures (Œ¶s ~ 0.01). However, recent observations revealed the presence of unusually high solid fraction nanoscale textures (Œ¶s ~ 0.25 to 0.64) on water-repellent insect surfaces, which cannot be explained by existing wetting theories. Here, we show that the contact time of bouncing droplets on high solid fraction surfaces can be reduced by reducing the texture size to ~100 nm. We demonstrated that the texture size‚Äìdependent contact time reduction could be attributed to the dominance of line tension on nanotextures and that compact arrangement of nanotextures is essential to withstand the impact pressure of raindrops. Our findings illustrate a potential survival strategy of insects to rapidly shed impacting raindrops, and suggest a previously unidentified design principle to engineering robust water-repellent materials for applications including miniaturized drones.",TRUE
Companion planting with French marigolds protects tomato plants from glasshouse whiteflies through the emission of airborne limonene,"Horticulturalists and gardeners in temperate regions often claim that planting marigolds next to tomato plants protects the tomatoes from the glasshouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood). If shown to hold true, this technique could be used in larger-scale tomato production, protecting the crop and helping to introduce greater plant diversity into these agro-ecosystems. Here we present two large-scale glasshouse trials corresponding to the two main ways growers are likely to use marigolds to control whiteflies. In the first, marigolds are grown next to tomato throughout the growing period and we quantify whitefly population growth from the seedling stage over a 48 day infestation period. Here we show that association with marigolds significantly slows whitefly population development. Introducing additional whitefly-attractive ‚Äòpull‚Äô plants around the perimeter of plots has little effect, but reducing the proportion of marigolds and introducing other non-hosts of whiteflies (basil, nasturtium and Chinese cabbage) also reduces whitefly populations on tomato. The second experiment assesses the efficacy of marigolds when used as an ‚Äòemergency‚Äô measure. Here we allow whitefly populations to build to a high density on unprotected tomatoes then introduce marigolds and assess whitefly population over a further period. Following laboratory work showing limonene to be a major chemical component of French marigolds and a negative behaviour response of whiteflies to this compound, limonene dispensers are added as an additional treatment to this experiment. ‚ÄúEmergency‚Äù marigold companion planting yielded minimal reductions in whitefly performance, but the use of limonene dispensers was more effective. Our work indicates that companion planting short vine tomatoes with French marigolds throughout the growing season will slow development of whitefly populations. Introducing marigolds to unprotected tomatoes after significant whitefly build-up will be less effective. The use of limonene dispensers placed near to tomato plants also shows promise. It is argued that this work supports the possibility of the development of a mixture of tomato companion plants that infer ‚Äòassociational resistance‚Äô against many major invertebrate pests of tomato. Such a mixture, if comprising edible or ornamental plants, would be economically viable, would reduce the need for additional chemical and biological control, and, if used outdoors, would generate plant-diverse agro-ecosystems that are better able to harbour invertebrate wildlife.",TRUE
Comparative jet wake structure and swimming performance of salps,"SUMMARY Salps are barrel-shaped marine invertebrates that swim by jet propulsion. Morphological variations among species and life-cycle stages are accompanied by differences in swimming mode. The goal of this investigation was to compare propulsive jet wakes and swimming performance variables among morphologically distinct salp species (Pegea confoederata, Weelia (Salpa) cylindrica, Cyclosalpa sp.) and relate swimming patterns to ecological function. Using a combination of in situ dye visualization and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements, we describe properties of the jet wake and swimming performance variables including thrust, drag and propulsive efficiency. Locomotion by all species investigated was achieved via vortex ring propulsion. The slow-swimming P. confoederata produced the highest weight-specific thrust (T=53 N kg‚Äì1) and swam with the highest whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (Œ∑wc=55%). The fast-swimming W. cylindrica had the most streamlined body shape but produced an intermediate weight-specific thrust (T=30 N kg‚Äì1) and swam with an intermediate whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (Œ∑wc=52%). Weak swimming performance variables in the slow-swimming C. affinis, including the lowest weight-specific thrust (T=25 N kg‚Äì1) and lowest whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (Œ∑wc=47%), may be compensated by low energetic requirements. Swimming performance variables are considered in the context of ecological roles and evolutionary relationships.",TRUE
"Comparative overwintering physiology of Alaska and Indiana populations of the beetle Cucujus clavipes (Fabricius): roles of antifreeze proteins, polyols, dehydration and diapause","SUMMARY The beetle Cucujus clavipes is found in North America over a broad latitudinal range from North Carolina (latitude ‚àº35¬∞N) to near tree line in the Brooks Range in Alaska (latitude, ‚àº67¬∞30‚Ä≤ N). The cold adaptations of populations from northern Indiana (‚àº41¬∞45‚Ä≤ N) and Alaska were compared and, as expected, the supercooling points (the temperatures at which they froze) of these freeze-avoiding insects were significantly lower in Alaska insects. Both populations produce glycerol, but the concentrations in Alaska larvae were much higher than in Indiana insects (‚àº2.2 and 0.5 mol l‚Äì1, respectively). In addition, both populations produce antifreeze proteins. Interestingly, in the autumn both populations have the same approximate level of hemolymph thermal hysteresis, indicative of antifreeze protein activity, suggesting that they synthesize similar amounts of antifreeze protein. A major difference is that the Alaska larvae undergo extreme dehydration in winter wherein water content decreases from 63‚Äì65% body water (1.70‚Äì1.85 g H2O g‚Äì1 dry mass) in summer to 28‚Äì40% body water (0.40‚Äì0.68 g H2O g‚Äì1 dry mass) in winter. These 2.5‚Äì4.6-fold reductions in body water greatly increase the concentrations of antifreeze in the Alaska insects. Glycerol concentrations would increase to 7‚Äì10 mol l‚Äì1 while thermal hysteresis increased to nearly 13¬∞C (the highest ever measured in any organism) in concentrated hemolymph. By contrast, Indiana larvae do not desiccate in winter. The Alaska population also undergoes a diapause while insects from Indiana do not. The result of these, and likely additional, adaptations is that while the mean winter supercooling points of Indiana larvae were approximately ‚Äì23¬∞C, those of Alaska larvae were ‚Äì35 to‚Äì 42¬∞C, and at certain times Alaska C. clavipes did not freeze when cooled to ‚Äì80¬∞C.",TRUE
Comparison of IR thermography and thermocouple measurement of heat loss from rabbit pinna,"The temperature of the pinnae of male New Zealand White rabbits was measured by use of infrared thermography. At ambient temperatures of 15, 20, and 25 degrees C, the average pinna temperatures were 23.0, 28.7, and 36.2 degrees C, respectively. From these temperatures, average heat loss from the total pinna surface area was calculated to be 2.8, 3.3, and 4.4 W, respectively. Preoptic temperature changes also affect the vasomotor state of the rabbit. At an ambient temperature of 20 degrees C, cooling the preoptic area of the rabbit by approximately 1 degree C resulted in an average pinna temperature of 26.5 degrees C and a heat loss of 2.4 W. Heating the preoptic area by approximately 1 degree C resulted in an average pinna temperature of 33.5 degrees C and a heat loss of 5.4 W. Finally, pinna temperatures were measured by use of a thermocouple and infrared thermography simultaneously. When the pinnae were vasodilated, the thermocouple measurements were consistently higher than the pinna surface temperatures measured thermographically. When the pinnae were vasoconstricted, the thermocouple measurements were consistently lower than the pinna surface temperatures measured thermographically. The discrepancy between the two methods of measurement is discussed.",TRUE
Comparison of the structure and mechanical properties of bovine femur bone and antler of the North American elk (Cervus elaphus canadensis).,"Antler and limb bone have a similar microstructure and chemical composition. Both are primarily composed of type I collagen and a mineral phase (carbonated apatite), arranged in osteons in compact (cortical bone) sections and a lamellar structure in the cancellous (spongy or trabecular bone) sections. The mineral content is lower in antler bone and it has a core of cancellous bone surrounded by compact bone running through the main beam and tines. The mineral content is higher in the compact compared with the cancellous bone, although there is no difference in ratios of the mineral elements with calcium. Mechanical tests (bend and compression) on longitudinal and transverse orientations of dry and rehydrated compact bone of North American elk (Cervus elaphus canadensis) antlers are compared with known data on other antlers as well as bovine femora. Both dry and rehydrated bones are highly anisotropic, with the bending and compressive strength and elastic modulus higher in the longitudinal than in the transverse direction. There is no significant difference between the bend strength and elastic modulus between dry and rehydrated samples tested in the transverse direction. The elastic modulus measured from the bending tests is compared with composite models. The elastic modulus and bend strengths are lower in the rehydrated condition, but the strain to failure and fracture toughness is much higher compared with dry samples. All antler bone mechanical properties are lower than that of bovine femora. The antler has a much higher fracture toughness compared with bovine femora, which correlates with their main function in intraspecific combat as a high impact resistant, energy absorbent material. A model of compression deformation is proposed, which is based on osteon sliding during shear.",TRUE
COMPOSITION OF EXTRACELLULAR POLYMERIC SUBSTANCES FROM PERIPHYTON ASSEMBLAGES IN THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES 1,"In wetland habitats, periphyton is a common component of open‚Äêwater areas with species assemblage determined by local water quality. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secreted by algae and bacteria give structure to periphyton, and differences in EPS chemistry affect the functional roles of these polymers. The Florida Everglades provide a unique opportunity to study compositional differences of EPS from distinctive algal assemblages that characterize areas of differing water chemistry. Water conservation area (WCA)‚Äê1 is a soft‚Äêwater impoundment; periphyton was loosely associated with Utricularia stems and amorphous in structure, with a diverse desmid and diatom assemblage, and varying cyanobacterial abundance. Extracellular polymers were abundant and were loosely cell‚Äêassociated sheaths and slime layers in addition to tightly cell‚Äêassociated capsules. The EPS were complex heteropolysaccharides with significant saccharide residues of glucose, xylose, arabinose, and fucose. Carboxylic acids were also prominent, while ester sulfates and proteins were small components. Structured, cohesive cyanobacteria‚Äêdominated periphyton was observed in WCA‚Äê2A, a minerotrophic impoundment, and filaments were heavily encrusted with calcium carbonate and detrital matter. EPS were primarily cell‚Äêassociated sheaths, and polymer residues were dominated by glucose, xylose, fucose, and galactose, with uronic acids also a significant component of the polymers. Principal components analysis revealed that periphyton community assemblage determined the monosaccharide composition of EPS, which ultimately determines a range of biogeochemical processes within the periphyton.",TRUE
Comprehensive Mapping of Long-Range Interactions Reveals Folding Principles of the Human Genome,"Chromosomal Mapping The conformation of the genome in the nucleus and contacts between both proximal and distal loci influence gene expression. In order to map genomic contacts, Lieberman-Aiden et al. (p. 289, see the cover) developed a technique to allow the detection of all interactions between genomic loci in the eukaryotic nucleus followed by deep sequencing. This technology was used to map the organization of the human genome and to examine the spatial proximity of chromosomal loci at one megabase resolution. The map suggests that the genome is partitioned into two spatial compartments that are related to local chromatin state and whose remodeling correlates with changes in the chromatin state. Chromosomes are organized in a fractal knot-free conformation that is densely packed while easily folded and unfolded. We describe Hi-C, a method that probes the three-dimensional architecture of whole genomes by coupling proximity-based ligation with massively parallel sequencing. We constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with Hi-C at a resolution of 1 megabase. These maps confirm the presence of chromosome territories and the spatial proximity of small, gene-rich chromosomes. We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.",TRUE
Congruence of epicuticular hydrocarbons and tarsal secretions as a principle in beetles,"Within beetles, those species that are adapted to life on plants have developed widened tarsi with specialised hairy attachment structures. The capability to adhere to smooth surfaces is based on a liquid film on the surface of these structures, the composition of which is similar to the cuticular lipids. By means of a cluster analysis based on chemical similarities between samples obtained from tarsi or elytra of 35 species using solid phase microextraction, the present study strongly suggests that this chemical congruence is a principle in beetles. This supports the idea of tarsal liquids being part of the cuticular lipid layer and contributes to the understanding of liquid-mediated attachment systems.",TRUE
Conservation of essential design features in coiled coil silks,"Silks are strong protein fibers produced by a broad array of spiders and insects. The vast majority of known silks are large, repetitive proteins assembled into extended beta-sheet structures. Honeybees, however, have found a radically different evolutionary solution to the need for a building material. The 4 fibrous proteins of honeybee silk are small ( approximately 30 kDa each) and nonrepetitive and adopt a coiled coil structure. We examined silks from the 3 superfamilies of the Aculeata (Hymenoptera: Apocrita) by infrared spectroscopy and found coiled coil structure in bees (Apoidea) and in ants (Vespoidea) but not in parasitic wasps of the Chrysidoidea. We subsequently identified and sequenced the silk genes of bumblebees, bulldog ants, and weaver ants and compared these with honeybee silk genes. Each species produced orthologues of the 4 small fibroin proteins identified in honeybee silk. Each fibroin contained a continuous predicted coiled coil region of around 210 residues, flanked by 23-160 residue length N- and C-termini. The cores of the coiled coils were unusually rich in alanine. There was extensive sequence divergence among the bee and ant silk genes (<50% similarity between the alignable regions of bee and ant sequences), consistent with constant and equivalent divergence since the bee/ant split (estimated to be 155 Myr). Despite a high background level of sequence diversity, we have identified conserved design elements that we propose are essential to the assembly and function of coiled coil silks.",TRUE
Contribution of the alternative pathway to respiration during thermogenesis in flowers of the sacred lotus,"We report results from in vivo measurements, using oxygen isotope discrimination techniques, of fluxes through the alternative and cytochrome respiratory pathways in thermogenic plant tissue, the floral receptacle of the sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera). Fluxes through both pathways were measured in thermoregulating flowers undergoing varying degrees of thermogenesis in response to ambient temperature. Significant increases in alternative pathway flux were found in lotus receptacles with temperatures 16 degrees C to 20 degrees C above ambient, but not in those with lesser amounts of heating. Alternative pathway flux in the hottest receptacles was 75% of the total respiratory flux. In contrast, fluxes through the cytochrome pathway did not change significantly during thermogenesis. These data support the hypothesis that increased flux through the alternative pathway is responsible for heating in the lotus and that it is unlikely that uncoupling proteins, which would have produced increased fluxes through the cytochrome pathway, contribute significantly to heating in this tissue. Comparisons of actual flux, with capacity determined using inhibitors, suggested that the alternative pathway was operating at close to maximum capacity in heating tissues of lotus. However, in nonheating tissues the inhibitor data significantly overestimated the alternative pathway flux. This confirms that isotopic measurements are necessary for accurate determination of fluxes through the two pathways.",TRUE
Contributions of feather microstructure to eider down insulation properties,"Insulation is an essential component of nest structure that helps provide incubation requirements for birds. Many species of waterfowl breed in high latitudes where rapid heat loss can necessitate a high energetic input from parents and use down feathers to line their nests. Common eider Somateria mollissima nest down has exceptional insulating properties but the microstructural mechanisms behind the feather properties have not been thoroughly examined.  Here, we hypothesized that insulating properties of nest down are correlated to down feather (plumule) microstructure. We tested the thermal efficiency (fill power) and cohesion of plumules from nests of two Icelandic colonies of wild common eiders and compared them to properties of plumules of wild greylag goose Anser anser. We then used electron microscopy to examine the morphological basis of feather insulating properties. We found that greylag goose down has higher fill power (i.e. traps more air) but much lower cohesion (i.e. less prone to stick together) compared to common eider down. These differences were related to interspecific variation in feather microstructure. Down cohesion increased with the number of barbule microstructures (prongs) that create strong points of contact among feathers. Eider down feathers also had longer barbules than greylag goose down feathers, likely increasing their air-trapping capacity. Feather properties of these two species might reflect the demands of their contrasting evolutionary history. In greylag goose, a temperate, terrestrial species, plumule microstructure may optimize heat trapping. In common eiders, a diving duck that nests in arctic and subarctic waters, plumule structure may have evolved to maximize cohesion over thermal insulation, which would both reduce buoyancy during their foraging dives and enable nest down to withstand strong arctic winds.",TRUE

Control of the Selectivity of the Aquaporin Water Channel Family by Global Orientational Tuning,"Aquaporins are transmembrane channels found in cell membranes of all life forms. We examine their apparently paradoxical property, facilitation of efficient permeation of water while excluding protons, which is of critical importance to preserving the electrochemical potential across the cell membrane. We have determined the structure of the Escherichia coliaquaglyceroporin GlpF with bound water, in native (2.7 angstroms) and in W48F/F200T mutant (2.1 angstroms) forms, and carried out 12-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations that define the spatial and temporal probability distribution and orientation of a single file of seven to nine water molecules inside the channel. Two conserved asparagines force a central water molecule to serve strictly as a hydrogen bond donor to its neighboring water molecules. Assisted by the electrostatic potential generated by two half-membrane spanning loops, this dictates opposite orientations of water molecules in the two halves of the channel, and thus prevents the formation of a ‚Äúproton wire,‚Äù while permitting rapid water diffusion. Both simulations and observations revealed a more regular distribution of channel water and an increased water permeability for the W48F/F200T mutant.",TRUE
Convergent evolution in mechanical design of lamnid sharks and tunas,"The evolution of ‚Äòthunniform‚Äô body shapes in several different groups of vertebrates, including whales, ichthyosaurs and several species of large pelagic fishes supports the view that physical and hydromechanical demands provided important selection pressures to optimize body design for locomotion during vertebrate evolution. Recognition of morphological similarities between lamnid sharks (the most well known being the great white and the mako) and tunas has led to a general expectation that they also have converged in their functional design; however, no quantitative data exist on the mechanical performance of the locomotor system in lamnid sharks. Here we examine the swimming kinematics, in vivo muscle dynamics and functional morphology of the force-transmission system in a lamnid shark, and show that the evolutionary convergence in body shape and mechanical design between the distantly related lamnids and tunas is much more than skin deep; it extends to the depths of the myotendinous architecture and the mechanical basis for propulsive movements. We demonstrate that not only have lamnids and tunas converged to a much greater extent than previously known, but they have also developed morphological and functional adaptations in their locomotor systems that are unlike virtually all other fishes.",TRUE
Convergent evolution of metabolic roles in bacterial co-symbionts of insects,"A strictly host-dependent lifestyle has profound evolutionary consequences for bacterial genomes. Most prominent is a sometimes-dramatic amount of gene loss and genome reduction. Recently, highly reduced genomes from the co-resident intracellular symbionts of sharpshooters were shown to exhibit a striking level of metabolic interdependence. One symbiont, called Sulcia muelleri (Bacteroidetes), can produce eight of the 10 essential amino acids, despite having a genome of only 245 kb. The other, Baumannia cicadellinicola (Œ≥-Proteobacteria), can produce the remaining two essential amino acids as well as many vitamins. Cicadas also contain the symbiont Sulcia, but lack Baumannia and instead contain the co-resident symbiont Hodgkinia cicadicola (Œ±-Proteobacteria). Here we report that, despite at least 200 million years of divergence, the two Sulcia genomes have nearly identical gene content and gene order. Additionally, we show that despite being phylogenetically distant and drastically different in genome size and architecture, Hodgkinia and Baumannia have converged on gene sets conferring similar capabilities for essential amino acid biosynthesis, in both cases precisely complementary to the pathways conserved in Sulcia. In contrast, they have completely divergent capabilities for vitamin biosynthesis. Despite having the smallest gene set known in bacteria, Hodgkinia devotes at least 7% of its proteome to cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis, a significant metabolic burden. The presence of these genes can be explained by Hodgkinia's retention of the cobalamin-dependent version of methionine synthase instead of the cobalamin-independent version found in Baumannia, a situation that necessitates retention of cobalamin biosynthetic capabilities to make the essential amino acid methionine.",TRUE
Conversion of dibenzothiophene by the mushrooms Agrocybe aegerita and Coprinellus radians and their extracellular peroxygenases,"The conversion of the heterocycle dibenzothiophene (DBT) by the agaric basidiomycetes Agrocybe aegerita and Coprinellus radians was studied in vivo and in vitro with whole cells and with purified extracellular peroxygenases, respectively. A. aegerita oxidized DBT (110¬†ŒºM) by 100% within 16¬†days into eight different metabolites. Among the latter were mainly S-oxidation products (DBT sulfoxide, DBT sulfone) and in lower amounts, ring-hydroxylation compounds (e.g., 2-hydroxy-DBT). C. radians converted about 60% of DBT into DBT sulfoxide and DBT sulfone as the sole metabolites. In vitro tests with purified peroxygenases were performed to compare the product pattern with the metabolites formed in vivo. Using ascorbic acid as radical scavenger, a total of 19 and seven oxygenation products were detected after DBT conversion by the peroxygenases of A. aegerita (AaP) and C. radians (CrP), respectively. Whereas ring hydroxylation was favored over S-oxidation by AaP (again 2-hydroxy-DBT was identified), CrP formed DBT sulfoxide as major product. This finding suggests that fungal peroxygenases can considerably differ in their catalytic properties. Using H218O2, the origin of oxygen was proved to be the peroxide. Based on these results, we propose that extracellular peroxygenases may be involved in the oxidation of heterocycles by fungi also under natural conditions.",TRUE
"Cooperating to compete: altruism, sexual selection and causes of male reproductive cooperation","Competition among males for access to reproductive opportunities is a central tenet of behavioural biology that has critical implications for studies of mating systems, sexual selection and the evolution of numerous phenotypic traits. Given the expectation that males should compete vigorously for access to females, it may at first seem paradoxical that males in some species cooperate to reproduce, often resulting in the apparent sacrifice of direct fitness by some members of these cooperative partnerships. Because this form of cooperation lies at the interface between natural, sexual and kin selection, studies of the adaptive consequences of male reproductive cooperation may yield important insights into how complex and sometimes conflicting selective pressures shape individual behaviour. Here, we define and review examples of reproductive cooperation among male animals. We take an integrative approach to reviewing the potential causes of maleemale cooperation, including potential adaptive hypotheses, ecological correlates, phylogenetic patterns and physiological mechanisms. The impact of male reproductive cooperation on sexual selection theory is also discussed. We conclude by outlining several important directions for future research, including efforts to improve understanding of the ecological and demographic contexts in which male reproductive cooperation occurs. Collectively, such analyses promise to improve our understanding of multiple fundamental concepts in evolutionary biology. 2013 The Authors.

Cooperative Display and Lekking Behavior of the Lance-Tailed Manakin (Chiroxiphia Lanceolata),"Male Lance-tailed Manakins (Chiroxiphia lanceolata) perform multi-male courtship displays for females. To characterize the behavioral repertoire and the lek spatial organization of this species, I observed lekking males on Isla Boca Brava, Chiriqu√≠ Province, Panam√°. Breeding began in March and continued through June, though courtship displays were recorded as late as November. Males were active throughout the day at display areas on the dispersed lek. Display areas were spaced 102 ¬± 30 m apart and averaged 2,480 ¬± 1,060 m2 in area (range: 525‚Äì4,500 m2; n = 24 display areas). The behavioral repertoire of Lance-tailed Manakins included 11 dance display elements, 7 common vocalizations, and 2 types of male-male duet songs. Duet songs and multimale dances for females were cooperative efforts by male pairs and included display elements that were never performed during courtship displays by solitary males. However, males performed both cooperative and entirely solo displays for females that ended in successful copulation, which suggests that cooperation is not obligate in this species, at least on the level of individual displays. Two sonations, or nonvocal communicative sounds, were noted during courtship displays: low-amplitude pulses of noise produced in rapid sets of 7‚Äì30 clicks during slow flight displays, and a low-frequency woosh produced at the nadir of swoop displays. The Lance-tailed Manakin display repertoire provides information useful in comparative analyses of the origin and evolution of display behavior within the manakin clade and in studies of the adaptive consequences of individual behavior within this species.",TRUE
Coordinated Movements Prevent Jamming in an Emperor Penguin Huddle,"For Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri), huddling is the key to survival during the Antarctic winter. Penguins in a huddle are packed so tightly that individual movements become impossible, reminiscent of a jamming transition in compacted colloids. It is crucial, however, that the huddle structure is continuously reorganized to give each penguin a chance to spend sufficient time inside the huddle, compared with time spent on the periphery. Here we show that Emperor penguins move collectively in a highly coordinated manner to ensure mobility while at the same time keeping the huddle packed. Every 30‚Äì60 seconds, all penguins make small steps that travel as a wave through the entire huddle. Over time, these small movements lead to large-scale reorganization of the huddle. Our data show that the dynamics of penguin huddling is governed by intermittency and approach to kinetic arrest in striking analogy with inert non-equilibrium systems, including soft glasses and colloids.",TRUE
"Coordinated ventilation and spiracle activity produce unidirectional airflow in the hissing cockroach, Gromphadorhina portentosa","SUMMARY Insects exchange respiratory gases via an extensive network of tracheal vessels that open to the surface of the body through spiracular valves. Although gas exchange is known to increase with the opening of these spiracles, it is not clear how this event relates to gas flow through the tracheal system. We examined the relationship between respiratory airflow and spiracle activity in a ventilating insect, the hissing cockroach, Gromphadorhina portentosa, to better understand the complexity of insect respiratory function. Using simultaneous video recordings of multiple spiracular valves, we found that abdominal spiracles open and close in unison during periods of ventilation. Additionally, independent recordings of CO2 release from the abdominal and thoracic regions and observations of hyperoxic tracer gas movement indicate that air is drawn into the thoracic spiracles and expelled from the abdominal spiracles. Our video recordings suggest that this unidirectional flow is driven by abdominal contractions that occur when the abdominal spiracles open. The spiracles then close as the abdomen relaxes and fills with air from the thorax. Therefore, the respiratory system of the hissing cockroach functions as a unidirectional pump through the coordinated action of the spiracles and abdominal musculature. This mechanism may be employed by a broad diversity of large insects that respire by active ventilation.",TRUE
Copper-bottomed: electrochemically active bacteria exploit conductive sulphide networks for enhanced electrogeneity,"In this study, we demonstrate that anodic electroactive bacteria like Geobacter sulfurreducens generate copper(I) and copper(II) sulphides when grown on copper electrodes. The insoluble copper sulphides form a conductive network within the biofilms, strongly enhancing the biofilm electrogeneity ‚Äì i.e., the ability of the biofilm to produce electric currents. Compared to biofilms grown on graphite, the average relative current density of copper-based biofilms was 237%, with a maximum geometric current density of 1.59 ¬± 0.23 mA cm‚àí2. An additional electrochemical CuS deposition prior to biofilm cultivation further increased the bioelectrocatalytic current generation to 2 mA cm‚àí2. The chemical deposition of CuS onto graphite allowed cultivating biofilms with current densities 134% higher than at unmodified graphite. This approach ‚Äì the chemical CuS deposition onto inexpensive electrode materials ‚Äì thus represents a promising pathway for the development of scalable, high-performance electrode materials for microbial electrochemical technologies.",TRUE
Coral Fluorescent Proteins as Antioxidants,"Background A wide array of fluorescent proteins (FP) is present in anthozoans, although their biochemical characteristics and function in host tissue remain to be determined. Upregulation of FP's frequently occurs in injured or compromised coral tissue, suggesting a potential role of coral FPs in host stress responses. Methodology/Principal Findings The presence of FPs was determined and quantified for a subsample of seven healthy Caribbean coral species using spectral emission analysis of tissue extracts. FP concentration was correlated with the in vivo antioxidant potential of the tissue extracts by quantifying the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenging rates. FPs of the seven species varied in both type and abundance and demonstrated a positive correlation between H2O2 scavenging rate and FP concentration. To validate this data, the H2O2 scavenging rates of four pure scleractinian FPs, cyan (CFP), green (GFP), red (RFP) and chromoprotein (CP), and their mutant counterparts (without chromophores), were investigated. In vitro, each FP scavenged H2O2 with the most efficient being CP followed by equivalent activity of CFP and RFP. Scavenging was significantly higher in all mutant counterparts. Conclusions/Significance Both naturally occurring and pure coral FPs have significant H2O2 scavenging activity. The higher scavenging rate of RFP and the CP in vitro is consistent with observed increases of these specific FPs in areas of compromised coral tissue. However, the greater scavenging ability of the mutant counterparts suggests additional roles of scleractinian FPs, potentially pertaining to their color. This study documents H2O2 scavenging of scleractinian FPs, a novel biochemical characteristic, both in vivo across multiple species and in vitro with purified proteins. These data support a role for FPs in coral stress and immune responses and highlights the multi-functionality of these conspicuous proteins.",TRUE
Coral Skeletons Defend against Ultraviolet Radiation,"Background Many coral reef organisms are photosynthetic or have evolved in tight symbiosis with photosynthetic symbionts. As such, the tissues of reef organisms are often exposed to intense solar radiation in clear tropical waters and have adapted to trap and harness photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). High levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) associated with sunlight, however, represent a potential problem in terms of tissue damage. Methodology/Principal Findings By measuring UVR and PAR reflectance from intact and ground bare coral skeletons we show that the property of calcium carbonate skeletons to absorb downwelling UVR to a significant extent, while reflecting PAR back to the overlying tissue, has biological advantages. We placed cnidarians on top of bare skeletons and a UVR reflective substrate and showed that under ambient UVR levels, UVR transmitted through the tissues of cnidarians placed on top of bare skeletons were four times lower compared to their counterparts placed on a UVR reflective white substrate. In accordance with the lower levels of UVR measured in cnidarians on top of coral skeletons, a similar drop in UVR damage to their DNA was detected. The skeletons emitted absorbed UVR as yellow fluorescence, which allows for safe dissipation of the otherwise harmful radiation. Conclusions/Significance Our study presents a novel defensive role for coral skeletons and reveals that the strong UVR absorbance by the skeleton can contribute to the ability of corals, and potentially other calcifiers, to thrive under UVR levels that are detrimental to most marine life.",TRUE
"Correlation between aquaporin and water permeability in response to vasotocin, hydrin and Œ≤-adrenergic effectors in the ventral pelvic skin of the tree frog Hyla japonica","SUMMARY The ventral pelvic skin of the tree frog Hyla japonica expresses two kinds of arginine vasotocin (AVT)-stimulated aquaporins (AQP-h2 and AQP-h3), which affect the capacity of the frog's skin to absorb water. As such, it can be used as a model system for analyzing the molecular mechanisms of water permeability. We investigated AQP dynamics and water permeability in the pelvic skin of H. japonica following challenge with AVT, hydrins (intermediate peptides of pro-AVT) and Œ≤-adrenergic effectors. In the in vivo experiment, both AQP-h2 and AQP-h3 proteins were translocated to the apical plasma membrane in the principal cells of the first-reacting cell (FRC) layer in the pelvic skin following challenge with AVT, hydrin 1 and hydrin 2, thereby increasing the water permeability of the pelvic skin. The Œ≤-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (IP) and its anatagonist propranolol (PP) in combination with AVT or hydrins were used as challenge in the in vitro experiment. IP increased water permeability whereas PP inhibited it, and both events were well correlated with the translocation of the AQPs to the apical membrane. In the PP+AVT-treated skins, labels for AQP-h2 and AQP-h3 were differentially visible among the principal cells; the apical plasma membrane of some cells was labeled while others were not, indicating that the response of PP or AVT is different from cell to cell. These results provide morphological evidence that the principal cells of the FRC layers may have two kinds of receptors: a V2 receptor and Œ≤-adrenergic receptor.",TRUE
Correlation between the Circadian Rhythm of Resistance to Extreme Temperatures and Changes in Fatty Acid Composition in Cotton Seedlings,"Fluctuations in fatty acid composition were examined in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv Deltapine 50) leaves during light-dark cycles of 12:12 h and under continuous light and were correlated to the rhythmic changes in chilling (5[deg]C) resistance (CR) and heat (53[deg]C) resistance (HR). The chilling-resistant and chilling-sensitive phases developed in the dark or the light period, respectively, and this rhythm persisted under continuous light for three cycles. The heat-resistant phase developed in the light period and an additional peak of HR occurred in the middle of the dark period. Under continuous light, only one peak of HR developed, lasting from the middle of the subjective night to the middle of the subjective day. The amounts of palmitic and oleic acids were constant during the light-dark cycle and under continuous light, but those of linoleic and linolenic acids fluctuated, attaining a high level in the middle of the dark period or the subjective night, and a low level in the middle of the light period or the subjective day. A low temperature of 20[deg]C induced CR and affected changes in fatty acid composition similar to those that occurred during the daily CR phase. A high temperature of 40[deg]C induced HR but did not affect changes in fatty acid composition. The results in their entirety show that the CR that develops rhythmically as well as the low-temperature-induced CR coincide with increased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids. No correlation is found between changes in fatty acid composition and the HR that develops rhythmically or the high-temperature-induced HR.",TRUE
Cross-linking by protein oxidation in the rapidly setting gel-based glues of slugs,"SUMMARY The terrestrial slug Arion subfuscus secretes a glue that is a dilute gel with remarkable adhesive and cohesive strength. The function of this glue depends on metals, raising the possibility that metal-catalyzed oxidation plays a role. The extent and time course of protein oxidation was measured by immunoblotting to detect the resulting carbonyl groups. Several proteins, particularly one with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 165√ó103, were heavily oxidized. Of the proteins known to distinguish the glue from non-adhesive mucus, only specific size variants were oxidized. The oxidation appears to occur within the first few seconds of secretion. Although carbonyls were detected by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in denatured proteins, they were not easily detected in the native state. The presence of reversible cross-links derived from carbonyls was tested for by treatment with sodium borohydride, which would reduce uncross-linked carbonyls to alcohols, but stabilize imine bonds formed by carbonyls and thus lead to less soluble complexes. Consistent with imine bond formation, sodium borohydride led to a 20‚Äì35% decrease in the amount of soluble protein with a Mr of 40‚Äì165 (√ó103) without changing the carbonyl content per protein. In contrast, the nucleophile hydroxylamine, which would competitively disrupt imine bonds, increased protein solubility in the glue. Finally, the primary amine groups on a protein with a Mr of 15√ó103 were not accessible to acid anhydrides. The results suggest that cross-links between aldehydes and primary amines contribute to the cohesive strength of the glue.",TRUE
Crossflow filtration in suspension-feeding fishes,"Rows of comb-like or tufted gill rakers in the oral cavity of suspension-feeding fishes (for example, herring, anchovies and tilapia) have been thought to serve as (1) non-porous barriers that direct particle-laden water to the sticky oral roof, where particles are retained as water exits from the oral cavity, (2) conventional dead-end filters that sieve particles from water exiting between rakers, or (3) sticky filters that retain particles encountered by a hydrosol filtration mechanism. Here we present data from computational fluid dynamics and video endoscopy in suspension-feeding fish indicating that the rakers of three distantly related species function instead as a crossflow filter. Particles are concentrated inside the oral cavity as filtrate exits between the rakers, but particles are not retained on the rakers. Instead, the high-velocity crossflow along the rakers carries particles away from the raker surfaces and transports the particles towards the oesophagus. This crossflow prevents particles from clogging the gaps between the rakers, and solves the mystery of particle transport from the rakers to the oesophagus.",TRUE
Cryo-EM Model of the Bullet-Shaped Vesicular Stomatitis Virus,"VSV in 3D Rhabdoviruses are a family of negative-stranded RNA viruses that includes rabies virus, which have a characteristic bullet shape. Though structures of individual rhabdovirus proteins have been reported, how these are organized into a bullet shape has remained unclear. Now, Ge et al. (p. 689) report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of a model rhabdovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus. The structural data and examination of mutants allows modeling of virion assembly. The structure of a negative-strand RNA virus suggests how bullet-shaped rhabdoviruses assemble. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a bullet-shaped rhabdovirus and a model system of negative-strand RNA viruses. Through direct visualization by means of cryo‚Äìelectron microscopy, we show that each virion contains two nested, left-handed helices: an outer helix of matrix protein M and an inner helix of nucleoprotein N and RNA. M has a hub domain with four contact sites that link to neighboring M and N subunits, providing rigidity by clamping adjacent turns of the nucleocapsid. Side-by-side interactions between neighboring N subunits are critical for the nucleocapsid to form a bullet shape, and structure-based mutagenesis results support this description. Together, our data suggest a mechanism of VSV assembly in which the nucleocapsid spirals from the tip to become the helical trunk, both subsequently framed and rigidified by the M layer.",TRUE
Cryptochrome 1 and phytochrome B control shade-avoidance responses in Arabidopsis via partially independent hormonal cascades,"Plants respond to a reduction in the red/far-red ratio (R:FR) of light, caused by the proximity of other plants, by initiating morphological changes that improve light capture. In Arabidopsis, this response (shade avoidance syndrome, SAS) is controlled by phytochromes (particularly phyB), and is dependent on the TAA1 pathway of auxin biosynthesis. However, when grown in real canopies, we found that phyB mutants and mutants deficient in TAAI (sav3) still display robust SAS responses to increased planting density and leaf shading. The SAS morphology (leaf hyponasty and reduced lamina/petiole ratio) could be phenocopied by exposing plants to blue light attenuation. These responses to blue light attenuation required the UV-A/blue light photoreceptor cry1. Moreover, they were mediated through mechanisms that showed only limited overlap with the pathways recruited by phyB inactivation. In particular, pathways for polar auxin transport, auxin biosynthesis and gibberellin signaling that are involved in SAS responses to low R:FR were not required for the SAS responses to blue light depletion. By contrast, the brassinosteroid response appeared to be required for the full expression of the SAS phenotype under low blue light. The phyB and cry1 inactivation pathways appeared to converge in their requirement for the basic/helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs 4 and 5 (PIF4 and PIF5) to elicit the SAS phenotype. Our results suggest that blue light is an important control of SAS responses, and that PIF4 and PIF5 are critical hubs for a diverse array of signaling routes that control plant architecture in canopies.",TRUE
Curvature-induced stiffening of a fish fin,"How fish modulate their fin stiffness during locomotive manoeuvres remains unknown. We show that changing the fin's curvature modulates its stiffness. Modelling the fin as bendable bony rays held together by a membrane, we deduce that fin curvature is manifested as a misalignment of the principal bending axes between neighbouring rays. An external force causes neighbouring rays to bend and splay apart, and thus stretches the membrane. This coupling between bending the rays and stretching the membrane underlies the increase in stiffness. Using three-dimensional reconstruction of a mackerel (Scomber japonicus) pectoral fin for illustration, we calculate the range of stiffnesses this fin is expected to span by changing curvature. The three-dimensional reconstruction shows that, even in its geometrically flat state, a functional curvature is embedded within the fin microstructure owing to the morphology of individual rays. As the ability of a propulsive surface to transmit force to the surrounding fluid is limited by its stiffness, the fin curvature controls the coupling between the fish and its surrounding fluid. Thereby, our results provide mechanical underpinnings and morphological predictions for the hypothesis that the spanned range of fin stiffnesses correlates with the behaviour and the ecological niche of the fish.",TRUE
Daily variation in cellular content of UV-absorbing compounds mycosporine-like amino acids in the marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae.,"Sudden exposure experiments to high PAR (photosynthetically available radiation) or high PAR+UVR (ultraviolet radiation) were conducted for the marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae acclimated to either low PAR or high PAR to determine the induction of cellular mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA) in relation to photosynthesis status. When the exposure to high PAR (30.8 Wm(-2)) was provided at different time in the light period for S. sweeneyae acclimated to low PAR (7.7 Wm(-2)) which suppressed photosynthesis, S. sweeneyae could enhance the induction of MAA but it only occurred in the first half of the light period. When UVR exposure was provided for the culture acclimated to high PAR which enhanced photosynthesis, cellular MAA content did not increase during the entire light period, but displayed daily variation similar to the control for two and half days. Daily variation of cellular MAA content did not synchronized with that of cell volume and cellular chlorophyll a content. The individual MAAs also revealed similar daily variations with different phase, which increased for a few hours in the beginning of the light period, except for cellular palythine content. Thus the total cellular MAA content revealed daily variation with changing the relative composition within a few hours. As one of the biological protective strategies against harmful UVR in sunlight, the daily vertical migration in the bloom forming dinoflagellates might be accompanied by the daily variation of cellular MAA content for a photosynthesis at daytime.",TRUE
Dampened NLRP3-mediated inflammation in bats and implications for a special viral reservoir host,"Bats are special in their ability to host emerging viruses. As the only flying mammal, bats endure high metabolic rates yet exhibit elongated lifespans. It is currently unclear whether these unique features are interlinked. The important inflammasome sensor, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), has been linked to both viral-induced and age-related inflammation. Here, we report significantly dampened activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bat primary immune cells compared to human or mouse counterparts. Lower induction of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) speck formation and secretion of interleukin-1Œ≤ in response to both ‚Äòsterile‚Äô stimuli and infection with multiple zoonotic viruses including influenza A virus (‚àísingle-stranded (ss) RNA), Melaka virus (PRV3M, double-stranded RNA) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (+ssRNA) was observed. Importantly, this reduction of inflammation had no impact on the overall viral loads. We identified dampened transcriptional priming, a novel splice variant and an altered leucine-rich repeat domain of bat NLRP3 as the cause. Our results elucidate an important mechanism through which bats dampen inflammation with implications for longevity and unique viral reservoir status.Dampened activation of the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in bat primary immune cells in response to infection with multiple zoonotic viruses is caused by decreased transcriptional priming, the presence of a unique splice variant and an altered leucine-rich repeat domain of bat NLRP3.",TRUE
Death by small forces: a fracture and fatigue analysis of wave-swept macroalgae,"SUMMARY Wave-swept macroalgae are subjected to large hydrodynamic forces as each wave breaks on shore, loads that are repeated thousands of times per day. Previous studies have shown that macroalgae can easily withstand isolated impositions of maximal field forces. Nonetheless, macroalgae break frequently. Here we investigate the possibility that repeated loading by sub-lethal forces can eventually cause fracture by fatigue. We determine fracture toughness, in the form of critical strain energy release rate, for several flat-bladed macroalgae, thereby assessing their resistance to complete fracture in the presence of cracks. Critical energy release rates are evaluated through single-edge-notch, pull-to-break tests and single-edge-notch, repeated-loading tests. Crack growth at sub-critical energy release rates is measured in repeated-loading tests, providing a first assessment of algal breakage under conditions of repeated loading. We then estimate the number of imposed waves required for un-notched algal blades to reach the point of complete fracture. We find that, if not checked by repair, fatigue crack growth from repeated sub-lethal stresses may completely fracture individuals within days. Our results suggest that fatigue may play an important role in macroalgal breakage.",TRUE
Decay of cacti and carbon cycling,"Cacti contain large quantities of Ca-oxalate biominerals, with C derived from atmospheric CO2. Their death releases these biominerals into the environment, which subsequently transform to calcite via a monohydrocalcite intermediate. Here, the fate of Ca-oxalates released by plants in arid environments is investigated. This novel and widespread form of biomineralization has unexpected consequences on C cycling and calcite accumulation in areas with large numbers of cacti. The magnitude of this mineralization is revealed by studying the large columnar cactus Carnegiea gigantea (Engelm.) Britton and Rose in southwestern Arizona (locally called the saguaro). A large C. gigantea contains on the order of 1√ó105¬†g of the Ca-oxalate weddellite‚ÄîCaC2O4¬∑2H2O. In areas with high C. gigantea density, there is an estimated 40¬†g Catm m‚àí2 sequestered in Ca-oxalates. Following the death of the plant, the weddellite transforms to calcite on the order to 10‚Äì20¬†years. In areas with high saguaro density, there is an estimated release of up to 2.4¬†g calcite m‚àí2¬†year‚àí1 onto the desert soil. Similar transformation mechanisms occur with the Ca-oxalates that are abundant in the majority of cacti. Thus, the total atmospheric C returned to the soil of areas with a high number density of cacti is large, suggesting that there may be a significant long-term accumulation of atmospheric C in these soils derived from Ca-oxalate biominerals. These findings demonstrate that plant decay in arid environments may have locally significant impacts on the Ca and inorganic C cycles.",TRUE
Deciphering links between bacterial interactions and spatial organization in multispecies biofilms,"Environmental microbes frequently live in multispecies biofilms where mutualistic relationships and co-evolution may occur, defining spatial organization for member species and overall community functions. In this context, intrinsic properties emerging from microbial interactions, such as efficient organization optimizing growth and activities in multispecies biofilms, may become the object of fitness selection. However, little is known on the nature of underlying interspecies interactions during establishment of a predictable spatial organization within multispecies biofilms. We present a comparative metatranscriptomic analysis of bacterial strains residing in triple-species and four-species biofilms, aiming at deciphering molecular mechanisms underpinning bacterial interactions responsible of the remarkably enhanced biomass production and associated typical spatial organization they display. Metatranscriptomic profiles concurred with changes in micro-site occupation in response to the addition/removal of a single species, being driven by both cooperation, competition, and facilitation processes. We conclude that the enhanced biomass production of the four-species biofilm is an intrinsic community property emerging from finely tuned space optimization achieved through concerted antagonistic and mutualistic interactions, where each species occupies a defined micro-site favoring its own growth. Our results further illustrate how molecular mechanisms can be better interpreted when supported by visual imaging of actual microscopic spatial organization, and we propose phenotypic adaptation selected by social interactions as molecular mechanisms stabilizing microbial communities.",TRUE
Deciphering the Rhizosphere Microbiome for Disease-Suppressive Bacteria,"A common plant pathogen induces the growth of disease-suppressive microbes in local soil communities. Disease-suppressive soils are exceptional ecosystems in which crop plants suffer less from specific soil-borne pathogens than expected owing to the activities of other soil microorganisms. For most disease-suppressive soils, the microbes and mechanisms involved in pathogen control are unknown. By coupling PhyloChip-based metagenomics of the rhizosphere microbiome with culture-dependent functional analyses, we identified key bacterial taxa and genes involved in suppression of a fungal root pathogen. More than 33,000 bacterial and archaeal species were detected, with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria consistently associated with disease suppression. Members of the Œ≥-Proteobacteria were shown to have disease-suppressive activity governed by nonribosomal peptide synthetases. Our data indicate that upon attack by a fungal root pathogen, plants can exploit microbial consortia from soil for protection against infections.",TRUE
"Deep supercooling, vitrification and limited survival to ‚Äì100¬∞C in the Alaskan beetle Cucujus clavipes puniceus (Coleoptera: Cucujidae) larvae","SUMMARY Larvae of the freeze-avoiding beetle Cucujus clavipes puniceus (Coleoptera: Cucujidae) in Alaska have mean supercooling points in winter of ‚Äì35 to ‚Äì42¬∞C, with the lowest supercooling point recorded for an individual of ‚Äì58¬∞C. We previously noted that some larvae did not freeze when cooled to ‚Äì80¬∞C, and we speculated that these larvae vitrified. Here we present evidence through differential scanning calorimetry that C. c. puniceus larvae transition into a glass-like state at temperatures <‚Äì58¬∞C and can avoid freezing to at least ‚Äì150¬∞C. This novel finding adds vitrification to the list of insect overwintering strategies. While overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees, C. c. puniceus larvae may experience low ambient temperatures of around ‚Äì40¬∞C (and lower) when microhabitat is un-insulated because of low snow cover. Decreasing temperatures in winter are correlated with loss of body water from summer high levels near 2.0 to winter lows near 0.4 mg mg‚Äì1 dry mass and concomitant increases in glycerol concentrations (4‚Äì6 mol l‚Äì1) and thermal hysteresis. Finally, we provide direct evidence that Cucujus from Wiseman, Alaska, survive temperatures to ‚Äì100¬∞C.",TRUE
"Deep-Sea, Swimming Worms with Luminescent ‚ÄúBombs‚Äù","Several species of deep-sea polychaete worms have been discovered that have a bizarre predator distraction mechanism. By using remotely operated vehicles, we found seven previously unknown species of swimming annelid worms below 1800 meters. Specimens were large and bore a variety of elaborate head appendages. In addition, five species have pairs of ellipsoidal organs homologous to branchiae that produce brilliant green bioluminescence when autotomized. Five genes were used to determine the evolutionary relationships of these worms within Cirratuliformia. These species form a clade within Acrocirridae and were not closely related to either of the two known pelagic cirratuliforms. Thus, this clade represents a third invasion of the pelagic realm from Cirratuliformia. This finding emphasizes the wealth of discoveries to be made in pelagic and deep demersal habitats.",TRUE
Defense by foot adhesion in a beetle (Hemisphaerota cyanea).,"The beetle Hemisphaerota cyanea (Chrysomelidae; Cassidinae) responds to disturbance by activating a tarsal adhesion mechanism by which it secures a hold on the substrate. Its tarsi are oversized and collectively bear some 60,000 adhesive bristles, each with two terminal pads. While walking, the beetle commits but a small fraction of the bristles to contact with the substrate. But when assaulted, it presses its tarsi flatly down, thereby touching ground with all or nearly all of the bristles. Once so adhered, it can withstand pulling forces of up to 0.8 g ( approximately 60 times its body mass) for 2 min, and of higher magnitudes, up to >3 g, for shorter periods. Adhesion is secured by a liquid, most probably an oil. By adhering, the beetle is able to thwart attacking ants, given that it is able to cling more persistently than the ant persists in its assault. One predator, the reduviid Arilus cristatus, is able to feed on the beetle, possibly because by injecting venom it prevents the beetle from maintaining its tarsal hold.",TRUE
Defensive and chemical characterization of the froth produced by the cercopid Aphrophora cribrata,"Nymphs of the cercopid Aphrophora cribrata cover themselves with a frothy exudate while ingesting sap from their preferred host plant, the eastern white pine, Pinus strobus.

Defoliation of interior Douglas-fir elicits carbon transfer and stress signalling to ponderosa pine neighbors through ectomycorrhizal networks,"Extensive regions of interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca, IDF) forests in North America are being damaged by drought and western spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis). This damage is resulting from warmer and drier summers associated with climate change. To test whether defoliated IDF can directly transfer resources to ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosae) regenerating nearby, thus aiding in forest recovery, we examined photosynthetic carbon transfer and defense enzyme response. We grew pairs of ectomycorrhizal IDF ‚Äòdonor‚Äô and ponderosa pine ‚Äòreceiver‚Äô seedlings in pots and isolated transfer pathways by comparing 35‚ÄÖŒºm, 0.5‚ÄÖŒºm and no mesh treatments; we then stressed IDF donors either through manual defoliation or infestation by the budworm. We found that manual defoliation of IDF donors led to transfer of photosynthetic carbon to neighboring receivers through mycorrhizal networks, but not through soil or root pathways. Both manual and insect defoliation of donors led to increased activity of peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase and superoxide dismutase in the ponderosa pine receivers, via a mechanism primarily dependent on the mycorrhizal network. These findings indicate that IDF can transfer resources and stress signals to interspecific neighbors, suggesting ectomycorrhizal networks can serve as agents of interspecific communication facilitating recovery and succession of forests after disturbance.",TRUE
Deployment of hagfish slime thread skeins requires the transmission of mixing forces via mucin strands,"SUMMARY Hagfishes are benthic marine protovertebrates that secrete copious quantities of slime when threatened. The slime originates as a two-component glandular exudate comprised of coiled bundles of cytoskeletal intermediate filaments (thread skeins) and mucin vesicles. Holocrine secretion of the slime into seawater results in the rapid deployment of both fibrous and mucin components, resulting in about a liter of dilute slime. Deployment of the thread skeins involves their unraveling in a fraction of a second from a 150 Œºm-long ellipsoid bundle to a thread that is 100√ó longer. We hypothesized that thread skein deployment requires both vigorous hydrodynamic mixing and the presence of mucin vesicles, both of which are required for whole slime deployment. Here we provide evidence that mixing and mucin vesicles are indeed crucial for skein unraveling. Specifically, we show that mucin vesicles mixed into seawater swell and elongate into high-aspect ratio mucin strands that attach to the thread skeins, transmit hydrodynamic forces to them and effect their unraveling by loading them in tension. Our discovery of mucin strands in hagfish slime not only provides a mechanism for the rapid deployment of thread skeins in vivo, it also helps explain how hagfish slime is able to trap such impressive volumes of seawater via viscous entrainment. We believe that the deployment of thread skeins via their interaction with shear-elongated mucins represents a unique mechanism in biology and may lead to novel technologies for transmitting hydrodynamic forces to microscale particles that would typically be immune to such forces.",TRUE
Dermal bone in early tetrapods: a palaeophysiological hypothesis of adaptation for terrestrial acidosis,"The dermal bone sculpture of early, basal tetrapods of the Permo-Carboniferous is unlike the bone surface of any living vertebrate, and its function has long been obscure. Drawing from physiological studies of extant tetrapods, where dermal bone or other calcified tissues aid in regulating acid‚Äìbase balance relating to hypercapnia (excess blood carbon dioxide) and/or lactate acidosis, we propose a similar function for these sculptured dermal bones in early tetrapods. Unlike the condition in modern reptiles, which experience hypercapnia when submerged in water, these animals would have experienced hypercapnia on land, owing to likely inefficient means of eliminating carbon dioxide. The different patterns of dermal bone sculpture in these tetrapods largely correlates with levels of terrestriality: sculpture is reduced or lost in stem amniotes that likely had the more efficient lung ventilation mode of costal aspiration, and in small-sized stem amphibians that would have been able to use the skin for gas exchange.",TRUE
Desaturation of exhaled air in camels,"We have found that camels can reduce the water loss due to evaporation from the respiratory tract in two ways: (1) by decreasing the temperature of the exhaled air and (2) by removal of water vapour from this air, resulting in the exhalation of air at less than 100% relative humidity (r. h.). Camels were kept under desert conditions and deprived of drinking water. In the daytime the exhaled air was at or near body core temperature, while in the cooler night exhaled air was at or near ambient air temperature. In the daytime the exhaled air was fully saturated, but at night its humidity might fall to approximately 75% r. h. The combination of cooling and desaturation can provide a saving of water of 60% relative to exhalation of saturated air at body temperature. The mechanism responsible for cooling of the exhaled air is a simple heat exchange between the respiratory air and the surfaces of the nasal passageways. On inhalation these surfaces are cooled by the air passing over them, and on exhalation heat from the exhaled air is given off to these cooler surfaces. The mechanism responsible for desaturation of the air appears to depend on the hygroscopic properties of the nasal surfaces when the camel is dehydrated. The surfaces give off water vapour during inhalation and take up water from the respiratory air during exhalation. We have used a simple mechanical model to demonstrate the effectiveness of this mechanism.",TRUE
Desiccation resistance of adhesive secretion in the protocarnivorous plant Roridula gorgonias as an adaptation to periodically dry environment,"To analyse the change of mass in the resinous secretion of Roridula gorgonias, we carried out long-term measurements using a computerised ultra microbalance. In contrast to the aqueous mucilage of other carnivorous flypaper traps, this water-insoluble secretion does not desiccate even in dead and formalin-preserved plants. We found no significant desiccation of secretory drops within 10¬†h of continuous weighing. After 100¬†days of the secretion exposure to dry conditions, only about 8% of the mass was lost. Interestingly, returning these samples to humid conditions resulted in a mass recovery to the initial amount. This property of the secretion is discussed as an ecological adaptation to the periodically dry Fynbos habitat of the plant.",TRUE
Design complexity and fracture control in the equine hoof wall,"Morphological and mechanical studies were conducted on samples of equine hoof wall to help elucidate the relationship between form and function of this complex, hierarchically organized structure. Morphological findings indicated a dependence of tubule size, shape and helical alignment of intermediate filaments (IFs) within the lamellae on the position through the wall thickness. The plane of the intertubular IFs changed from perpendicular to the tubule axis in the inner wall to almost parallel to the tubule axis in the outer wall. Morphological data predicted the existence of three crack diversion mechanisms which might prevent cracks from reaching the sensitive, living tissues of the hoof: a mid-wall diversion mechanism of intertubular material to inhibit inward and upward crack propagation, and inner- and outer-wall diversion mechanisms that prevent inward crack propagation. Tensile and compact tension fracture tests were conducted on samples of fully hydrated equine hoof wall. Longitudinal stiffness decreased from 0.56 to 0.30 GPa proceeding inwardly, whereas ultimate (maximum) properties were constant. Fracture toughness parameters indicated that no compromise results from the declining stiffness, with J-integral values ranging from 5.5 to 7.8 kJ m-2 through the wall thickness; however, highest toughness was found in specimens with cracks initiated tangential to the wall surface (10.7 kJ m-2). Fracture paths agreed with morphological predictions and further suggested that the wall has evolved into a structure capable of both resisting and redirecting cracks initiated in numerous orientations.",TRUE
Dew condensation on desert beetle skin,"Some tenebrionind beetles inhabiting the Namib desert are known for using their body to collect water droplets from wind-blown fogs. We aim to determine whether dew water collection is also possible for desert insects. For this purpose, we investigated the infra-red emissivity, and the wetting and structural properties, of the surface of the elytra of a preserved specimen of Physasterna cribripes (Tenebrionid√¶) beetle, where the macro-structure appears as a series of ‚Äúbumps‚Äù, with ‚Äúvalleys‚Äù between them. Dew formation experiments were carried out in a condensation chamber. The surface properties (infra-red emissivity, wetting properties) were dominated by the wax at the elytra surface and, to a lower extent, its micro-structure. We performed scanning electron microscope on histological sections and determined the infra-red emissivity using a scanning pyrometer. The emissivity measured (0.95¬±0.07 between 8‚Äì14Œºm) was close to the black body value. Dew formation occurred on the insect‚Äôs elytra, which can be explained by these surface properties. From the surface coverage of the condensed drops it was found that dew forms primarily in the valleys between the bumps. The difference in droplet nucleation rate between bumps and valleys can be attributed to the hexagonal microstructure on the surface of the valleys, whereas the surface of the bumps is smooth. The drops can slide when they reach a critical size, and be collected at the insect's mouth.Graphical abstract",TRUE
Di-myo-inositol phosphate and novel UDP-sugars accumulate in the extreme hyperthermophile Pyrolobus fumarii,"The archaeon Pyrolobus fumarii, one of the most extreme members of hyperthermophiles known thus far, is able to grow at temperatures up to 113 degrees C. Over a decade after the description of this organism our knowledge about the structures and strategies underlying its remarkable thermal resistance remains incipient. The accumulation of a restricted number of charged organic solutes is a common response to heat stress in hyperthermophilic organisms and accordingly their role in thermoprotection has been often postulated. In this work, the organic solute pool of P. fumarii was characterized using 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR. Di-myo-inositol phosphate was the major solute (0.21 micromol/mg protein), reinforcing the correlation between the occurrence of this solute and hyperthermophily; in addition, UDP-sugars (total concentration 0.11 micromol/mg protein) were present. The structures of the two major UDP-sugars were identified as UDP-alpha-GlcNAc3NAc and UDP-alpha-GlcNAc3NAc-(4<--1)-beta-GlcpNAc3NAc. Interestingly, the latter compound appears to be derived from the first one by addition of a 2,3-N-acetylglucoronic acid unit, suggesting that these UDP-sugars are intermediates of an N-linked glycosylation pathway. To our knowledge the UDP-disaccharide has not been reported elsewhere. The physiological roles of these organic solutes are discussed.",TRUE
Die Spiegeloptik des Flu√ükrebsauges,"SummaryIn the superposition eye of the crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus), images are formed by radial plane mirrors arranged in an orthogonal pattern. The optical structure of the crayfish eye can be described as a family of virtual reflecting cone envelopes concentric around each direction in space. There exist two reflection mechanisms: total internal reflection at the sides of the crystalline cones and reflection by multilayer mirrors attached to the distal parts of the cones. Image-forming rays have to be reflected twice in the general case, and once in the case of perpendicular position of the plane of incidence and the mirror plane. For rays incident at small angles to the ommatidial axis, this condition is almost satisfied due to a particular axial variation of the refractive index of the crystalline cone, and for rays incident at large angles, due to the spectral reflecting properties of the multilayer reflector.",TRUE
"Diel variation in ammonia excretion, glutamine levels, and hydration status in two species of terrestrial isopods","Terrestrial isopods (suborder Oniscidea) excrete most nitrogen diurnally as volatile ammonia, and ammonia-loaded animals accumulate nonessential amino acids, which may constitute the major nocturnal nitrogen pool. This study explored the relationship between ammonia excretion, glutamine storage/mobilization, and water balance, in two sympatric species Ligidium lapetum (section Diplocheta), a hygric species; and Armadillidium vulgare (Section Crinocheta), a xeric species capable of water-vapor absorption (WVA). Ammonia excretion (12-h), tissue glutamine levels, and water contents were measured following field collection of animals at dusk and dawn. In both species, diurnal ammonia excretion exceeded nocturnal excretion four- to fivefold while glutamine levels increased four- to sevenfold during the night. Most glutamine was accumulated in the somatic tissues (""body wall""). While data support the role of glutamine in nocturnal nitrogen storage, potential nitrogen mobilization from glutamine breakdown (162 micromol g(-1) in A. vulgare) exceeds measured ammonia excretion (2.5 micromol g(-1)) over 60-fold. This may serve to generate the high hemolymph ammonia concentrations (and high P(NH3)) seen during volatilization. The energetic cost of ammonia volatilization is discussed in the light of these findings. Mean water contents were similar at dusk and dawn in both species, indicating that diel cycles of water depletion and replenishment were not occurring.",TRUE
Diet effects on honeybee immunocompetence,"The maintenance of the immune system can be costly, and a lack of dietary protein can increase the susceptibility of organisms to disease. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between protein nutrition and immunity in insects. Here, we tested in honeybees (Apis mellifera) whether dietary protein quantity (monofloral pollen) and diet diversity (polyfloral pollen) can shape baseline immunocompetence (IC) by measuring parameters of individual immunity (haemocyte concentration, fat body content and phenoloxidase activity) and glucose oxidase (GOX) activity, which enables bees to sterilize colony and brood food, as a parameter of social immunity. Protein feeding modified both individual and social IC but increases in dietary protein quantity did not enhance IC. However, diet diversity increased IC levels. In particular, polyfloral diets induced higher GOX activity compared with monofloral diets, including protein-richer diets. These results suggest a link between protein nutrition and immunity in honeybees and underscore the critical role of resource availability on pollinator health.",TRUE
"DIFFERENCES IN POLYSACCHARIDE STRUCTURE BETWEEN CALCIFIED AND UNCALCIFIED SEGMENTS IN THE CORALLINE CALLIARTHRON CHEILOSPORIOIDES (CORALLINALES, RHODOPHYTA) 1","The articulated coralline Calliarthron cheilosporioides Manza produces segmented fronds composed of calcified segments (intergenicula) separated by uncalcified joints (genicula), which allow fronds to bend and reorient under breaking waves in the wave‚Äêswept intertidal zone. Genicula are formed when calcified cells decalcify and restructure to create flexible tissue. The present study has identified important differences in the main agaran disaccharidic repeating units [‚Üí3)‚ÄêŒ≤‚Äêd‚ÄêGalp (1‚Üí 4)‚ÄêŒ±‚Äêl‚ÄêGalp(1‚Üí] synthesized by genicular and intergenicular segments. Based on chemical and spectroscopical analyses, we report that genicular cells from C. cheilosporioides biosynthesize a highly methoxylated galactan at C‚Äê6 position with low levels of branching with xylose side stubs on C‚Äê6 of the [‚Üí3)‚ÄêŒ≤‚Äêd‚ÄêGalp (1‚Üí] units, whereas intergenicular segments produce xylogalactans with high levels of xylose and low levels of 6‚ÄêO‚Äêmethyl Œ≤‚Äêd‚ÄêGal units. These data suggest that, during genicular development, xylosyl branched, 3‚Äêlinked Œ≤‚Äêd‚ÄêGalp units present in the xylogalactan backbones from intergenicular walls are mostly replaced by 6‚ÄêO‚Äêmethyl‚Äêd‚Äêgalactose units. We speculate that this structural shift is a consequence of a putative and specific methoxyl transferase that blocks the xylosylation on C‚Äê6 of the 3‚Äêlinked Œ≤‚Äêd‚ÄêGalp units. Changes in galactan substitutions may contribute to the distinct mechanical properties of genicula and may lend insight into the calcification process in coralline algae.",TRUE
Differential Response to Circularly Polarized Light by the Jewel Scarab Beetle Chrysina gloriosa,"Circularly polarized light is rare in the terrestrial environment, and cuticular reflections from scarab beetles are one of the few natural sources. Chrysina gloriosa LeConte 1854, a scarab beetle found in montane juniper forests of the extreme southwestern United States and northern Mexico, are camouflaged in juniper foliage; however, when viewed with right circularly polarizing filters, the beetles exhibit a stark black contrast. Given the polarization‚Äêspecific changes in the appearance of C. gloriosa, we hypothesized that C. gloriosa can detect circularly polarized light. We tested for phototactic response and differential flight orientation of C. gloriosa toward different light stimuli. Chrysina gloriosa exhibited (a) positive phototaxis, (b) differential flight orientation between linear and circularly polarized light stimuli of equal intensities, and (c) discrimination between circularly polarized and unpolarized lights of different intensities consistent with a model of circular polarization sensitivity based on a quarter‚Äêwave plate. These results demonstrate that C. gloriosa beetles respond differentially to circularly polarized light. In contrast, Chrysina woodi Horn 1885, a close relative with reduced circularly polarized reflection, exhibited no phototactic discrimination between linear and circularly polarized light. Circularly polarized sensitivity may allow C. gloriosa to perceive and communicate with conspecifics that remain cryptic to predators, reducing indirect costs of communication.",TRUE
Diffractive hygrochromic effect in the cuticle of the hercules beetle Dynastes hercules,"The elytra from dry specimens of the hercules beetle, Dynastes hercules appear khaki-green in a dry atmosphere and turn black passively under high humidity levels. New scanning electron images, spectrophotometric measurements and physical modelling are used to unveil the mechanism of this colouration switch. The visible dry-state greenish colouration originates from a widely open porous layer located 3‚ÄâŒºm below the cuticle surface. The structure of this layer is three-dimensional, with a network of filamentary strings, arranged in layers parallel to the cuticle surface and stiffening an array of strong cylindrical pillars oriented normal to the surface. Unexpectedly, diffraction plays a significant role in the broadband colouration of the cuticle in the dry state. The backscattering caused by this layer disappears when water infiltrates the structure and weakens the refractive index differences.",TRUE
Directional hearing in a silicon cricket,"Phonotaxis is the ability to orient towards or away from sound sources. Crickets can locate conspecifics by phonotaxis to the calling (mating) song they produce, and can evade bats by negative phonotaxis from echolocation calls. The behaviour and underlying physiology have been studied in some depth, and the auditory system solves this complex problem in a unique manner. Experiments conducted on a simulation model of the system indicated that the mechanism output a directional signal to sounds ahead at calling song frequency and to sounds behind at echolocation frequencies. We suggest that this combination of responses helps simplify later processing in the cricket. To further explore this result, an analogue, very large scale integrated (aVLSI) circuit model of the mechanism was designed and built; results from testing this agreed with the simulation. The aVLSI circuit was used to test a further hypothesis about the potential advantages of the positioning of the acoustic inputs for sound localisation during walking. There was no clear advantage to the directionality of the system in their location. The aVLSI circuitry is now being extended to use on a robot along with previously modelled neural circuitry to better understand the complete sensorimotor pathway.",TRUE
Directional water collection on wetted spider silk,"Many biological surfaces in both the plant and animal kingdom possess unusual structural features at the micro- and nanometre-scale that control their interaction with water and hence wettability. An intriguing example is provided by desert beetles, which use micrometre-sized patterns of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions on their backs to capture water from humid air. As anyone who has admired spider webs adorned with dew drops will appreciate, spider silk is also capable of efficiently collecting water from air. Here we show that the water-collecting ability of the capture silk of the cribellate spider Uloborus walckenaerius is the result of a unique fibre structure that forms after wetting, with the ‚Äòwet-rebuilt‚Äô fibres characterized by periodic spindle-knots made of random nanofibrils and separated by joints made of aligned nanofibrils. These structural features result in a surface energy gradient between the spindle-knots and the joints and also in a difference in Laplace pressure, with both factors acting together to achieve continuous condensation and directional collection of water drops around spindle-knots. Submillimetre-sized liquid drops have been driven by surface energy gradients or a difference in Laplace pressure, but until now neither force on its own has been used to overcome the larger hysteresis effects that make the movement of micrometre-sized drops more difficult. By tapping into both driving forces, spider silk achieves this task. Inspired by this finding, we designed artificial fibres that mimic the structural features of silk and exhibit its directional water-collecting ability.",TRUE
Directionally controlled fluorescence emission in butterflies,"Recently developed, high-efficiency, light-emitting diodes use two-dimensional photonic crystals to enhance the extraction of otherwise internally trapped light and multilayer reflectors to control the direction of light emission. This work describes the characterization of a naturally evolved light-extraction system on the wing scales of a small group of Papilio butterflies. The efficient extraction of fluorescence from these scales is facilitated by a two-dimensional photonic crystal slab that uses a multilayer to help control emission direction. Its light-extraction function is analogous to that of the light-emitting diode.",TRUE
Discovering the flight autostabilizer of fruit flies by inducing aerial stumbles,"Just as the Wright brothers implemented controls to achieve stable airplane flight, flying insects have evolved behavioral strategies that ensure recovery from flight disturbances. Pioneering studies performed on tethered and dissected insects demonstrate that the sensory, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems play important roles in flight control. Such studies, however, cannot produce an integrative model of insect flight stability because they do not incorporate the interaction of these systems with free-flight aerodynamics. We directly investigate control and stability through the application of torque impulses to freely flying fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and measurement of their behavioral response. High-speed video and a new motion tracking method capture the aerial ‚Äústumble,‚Äù and we discover that flies respond to gentle disturbances by accurately returning to their original orientation. These insects take advantage of a stabilizing aerodynamic influence and active torque generation to recover their heading to within 2¬∞ in < 60 ms. To explain this recovery behavior, we form a feedback control model that includes the fly‚Äôs ability to sense body rotations, process this information, and actuate the wing motions that generate corrective aerodynamic torque. Thus, like early man-made aircraft and modern fighter jets, the fruit fly employs an automatic stabilization scheme that reacts to short time-scale disturbances.",TRUE
Discovery of os cordis in the cardiac skeleton of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),"Cardiovascular diseases, especially idiopathic myocardial fibrosis, is one of the most significant causes of morbidity and mortality in captive great apes. This study compared the structure and morphology of 16 hearts from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) which were either healthy or affected by myocardial fibrosis using X-ray microtomography. In four hearts, a single, hyperdense structure was detected within the right fibrous trigone of the cardiac skeleton. High resolution scans and histopathology revealed trabecular bones in two cases, hyaline cartilage in another case and a focus of mineralised fibro-cartilaginous metaplasia with endochondral ossification in the last case. Four other animals presented with multiple foci of ectopic calcification within the walls of the great vessels. All hearts affected by marked myocardial fibrosis presented with bone or cartilage formation, and increased collagen levels in tissues adjacent to the bone/cartilage, while unaffected hearts did not present with os cordis or cartilago cordis. The presence of an os cordis has been described in some ruminants, camelids, and otters, but never in great apes. This novel research indicates that an os cordis and cartilago cordis is present in some chimpanzees, particularly those affected by myocardial fibrosis, and could influence the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death.",TRUE
Discovery of skin alkaloids in a miniaturized eleutherodactylid frog from Cuba,"Four phylogenetically independent lineages of frogs are currently known to sequester lipid-soluble skin alkaloids for which a dietary source has been demonstrated. We report here a remarkable fifth such instance, in Eleutherodactylus iberia and Eleutherodactylus orientalis, two species of miniaturized frogs of the family Eleutherodactylidae from Cuba. Six pumiliotoxins and two indolizidines were found in E. iberia, one of the smallest frogs in the world and characterized by a contrasting colour pattern for which we hypothesize an aposematic function. Analyses of stomach content indicated a numerical prevalence of mites with an important proportion of oribatids‚Äîa group of arthropods known to contain one of the pumiliotoxins detected in E. iberia. This suggests that miniaturization and specialization to small prey may have favoured the acquisition of dietary skin alkaloids in these amphibians.",TRUE
Dispersal-generated sexual selection in a beetle-riding pseudoscorpion,"SummaryAfter several generations within a decaying tree (Ficus spp.), populations of the pseudoscorpion Cordylochernes scorpioides disperse by climbing under the elytra of harlequin beetles (Acrocinus longimanus) eclosing from the tree. Because the beetles then fly to newly-decaying Ficus for mating and oviposition, they act as effective dispersal agents. Field experiments and observations indicate that this dispersal mode has been exploited by males who compete to remain on a beetle as a strategic site for inseminating females dispersing on it and on other beetles. Whereas beetles just eclosed from old trees carried large, female-biased groups of dispersing pseudoscorpions, beetles captured after their maiden flight generally carried a single large male. Multivariate morphometric analyses indicated that these beetle-riding males were much larger than individuals randomly sampled from trees, with fighting traits exhibiting the greatest potential for selection (highest ‚Äúphoretic‚Äù differentials). In females, sexual receptivity was significantly higher at the beginning of dispersal than at the end, suggesting that mating occurs on beetles. Field experiments confirmed that on-beetle insemination does take place and that small males are displaced from the ‚Äúsubelytral space‚Äù by larger rivals. By contrast, laboratory experiments suggest that large male size may not confer high mating success under the low-density conditions which characterize populations within trees. Thus, in addition to indicating a novel role for dispersal in the evolution of exaggerated male traits, this study suggests that oscillating sexual selection may be important in the maintenance of the extreme phenotypic variation exhibited by males of this species.",TRUE
"Distance, shape and more: recognition of object features during active electrolocation in a weakly electric fish","SUMMARY In the absence of light, the weakly electric fish Gnathonemus petersii detects and distinguishes objects in the environment through active electrolocation. In order to test which features of an object the fish use under these conditions to discriminate between differently shaped objects, we trained eight individuals in a food-rewarded, two-alternative, forced-choice procedure. All fish learned to discriminate between two objects of different shapes and volumes. When new object combinations were offered in non-rewarded test trials, fish preferred those objects that resembled the one they had been trained to (S+) and avoided objects resembling the one that had not been rewarded (S‚Äì). For a decision, fish paid attention to the relative differences between the two objects they had to discriminate. For discrimination, fish used several object features, the most important ones being volume, material and shape. The importance of shape was demonstrated by reducing the objects to their 3-dimensional contours, which sufficed for the fish to distinguish differently shaped objects. Our results also showed that fish attended strongly to the feature `volume', because all individuals tended to avoid the larger one of two objects. When confronted with metal versus plastic objects, all fish avoided metal and preferred plastic objects, irrespective of training. In addition to volume, material and shape, fish attended to additional parameters, such as corners or rounded edges. When confronted with two unknown objects, fish weighed up the positive and negative properties of these novel objects and based their decision on the outcome of this comparison. Our results suggest that fish are able to link and assemble local features of an electrolocation pattern to construct a representation of an object, suggesting that some form of a feature extraction mechanism enables them to solve a complex object recognition task.",TRUE
Distribution of unique red feather pigments in parrots,"In many birds, red, orange and yellow feathers are coloured by carotenoid pigments, but parrots are an exception. For over a century, biochemists have known that parrots use an unusual set of pigments to produce their rainbow of plumage colours, but their biochemical identity has remained elusive until recently. Here, we use high-performance liquid chromatography to survey the pigments present in the red feathers of 44 species of parrots representing each of the three psittaciform families. We found that all species used the same suite of five polyenal lipochromes (or psittacofulvins) to colour their plumage red, indicating that this unique system of pigmentation is remarkably conserved evolutionarily in parrots. Species with redder feathers had higher concentrations of psittacofulvins in their plumage, but neither feather colouration nor historical relatedness predicted the ratios in which the different pigments appeared. These polyenes were absent from blood at the time when birds were replacing their colourful feathers, suggesting that parrots do not acquire red plumage pigments from the diet, but instead manufacture them endogenously at growing feathers.",TRUE
Divergent investment strategies of Acacia myrmecophytes and the coexistence of mutualists and exploiters,"Ant-plant interactions represent a diversity of strategies, from exploitative to mutualistic, and how these strategies evolve is poorly understood. Here, we link physiological, ecological, and phylogenetic approaches to study the evolution and coexistence of strategies in the Acacia‚ÄìPseudomyrmex system. Host plant species represented 2 different strategies. High-reward hosts produced significantly more extrafloral nectar (EFN), food bodies, and nesting space than low-reward hosts, even when being inhabited by the same species of ant mutualist. High-reward hosts were more effectively defended against herbivores and exploited to a lower extent by nondefending ants than low-reward hosts. At the phenotypic level, secretion of EFN and ant activity were positively correlated and a mutualistic ant species induced nectar secretion, whereas a nondefending exploiter did not. All of these mechanisms contribute to the stable association of high-reward hosts with defending ant species. However, exploiter ants are less dependent on the host-derived rewards and can colonize considerable proportions of the low-reward hosts. Mapping these strategies onto phylogenetic trees demonstrated that the low-reward hosts represent the derived clade within a monophyletic group of obligate ant plants and that the observed exploiter ant species evolved their strategy without having a mutualistic ancestor. We conclude that both types of host strategies coexist because of variable net outcomes of different investment‚Äìpayoff regimes and that the effects of exploiters on the outcome of mutualisms can, thus, increase the diversity within the taxa involved.",TRUE
Diverse nanostructures underlie thin ultra-black scales in butterflies,"Recently, it has been shown that animals such as jumping¬†spiders, birds, and butterflies have evolved ultra-black coloration comparable to the blackest synthetic materials. Of these, certain papilionid butterflies have reflectances approaching 0.2%, resulting from a polydisperse honeycomb structure. It is unknown if other ultra-black butterflies use this mechanism. Here, we examine a phylogenetically diverse set of butterflies and demonstrate that other butterflies employ simpler nanostructures that achieve ultra-black coloration in scales thinner than synthetic alternatives. Using scanning electron microscopy, we find considerable interspecific variation in the geometry of the holes in the structures, and verify with finite-difference time-domain modeling that expanded trabeculae and ridges, found across ultra-black butterflies, reduce reflectance up to 16-fold. Our results demonstrate that butterflies produce ultra-black by creating a sparse material with high surface area to increase absorption and minimize surface reflection. We hypothesize that butterflies use ultra-black to increase the contrast of color signals. Nature has developed the ability to produce a wide range of optical effects most notably in the butterfly wing. Here, the authors report on the analysis of the structures responsible for ultra-black coloration across different butterflies and combine this with modelling to identify the key characteristics",TRUE
Do anemonefishes use molecular mimicry to avoid being stung by host anemones,"Anemonefishes are known to have a protective mucous coat that allows them to contact the tentacles of their host anemone without being stung. There are two conflicting hypotheses as to the source and biochemical properties of this mucous coating. One hypothesis proposes that anemonefishes acquire anemone substances from their hosts during the behavioral process of acclimation, that protect the fish from being stung. Anemonefishes are considered to use anemone mucus as ‚Äúchemical camouflage‚Äù or ‚Äúmacromolecular mimicry‚Äù to avoid recognition as ‚Äúnot-self‚Äù by the anemone, and possible subsequent stinging. Another hypothesis is that anemonefishes produce their own protective mucus coat, which lacks substances that elicit cnida (nematocyst and spirocyst) discharge by their hosts.  The present study used immunological techniques to test whether the anemonefish Amphiprion clarkii (Bennett) (which was innately protected from two of the anemones used in the present study) has a mucous coat that resembles the external mucus of anemones. Polyclonal antibodies were prepared to the mucus of four species of anemones [Heteractis crispa, (Ehrenberg) Stichodactyla haddoni (Saville-Kent), Macrodactyla doreenensis (Quoy and Gaimard), and Condylactis gigantea (Weinland)]. Ouchterlony (double immunodiffusion) tests showed that different antigens were present in the mucus of the four anemone species. Anemone antigens were not detected in the mucous coating of either naive (fish that had never before encountered sea anemones) or associated (those living with sea anemones) anemonefishes in Ouchterlony tests. However, more sensitive ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) tests showed that anemone mucus antigens were present in the mucous coating of associated anemonefish, but not naive fish. This showed that an innately protected A. clarkii does not produce a mucus coat that is biochemically similar to that of anemones, but that the same fish does acquire anemone substances in its mucus coat when it associates with anemones in aquaria. It remains to be shown whether these anemone substances actually provide the initial protection for those anemonefishes that must undergo acclimation behavior in order to keep from being stung by their host sea anemones, or additional protection for innately protected fishes.",TRUE
Do western boxelder bugs sunbathe for sanitation? Inferences from in vitro experiments,"When western boxelder bugs, Boisea rubrolineata (Barber) (Hemiptera: Rhopalidae), form aggregations in warm sunlight, they release from their posterior dorsal abdominal gland an odorous blend of monoterpenes with heretofore unknown biological function. In laboratory analyses and experiments, we show that bugs in warm sunlight, but not in shade, exude and spread copious amounts of monoterpenes onto their cuticle. These monoterpenes do not serve as a pheromone, but rather as a means of sanitation. They inhibit germination of conidia of the fungal pathogen Beauveria bassiana (Bals.‚ÄêCriv.) Vuill. (Hypocreales) as well as halt the growth of germinated spores. This prophylactic defense against pathogens appears adaptive for phytophagous insects, like B. rubrolineata, that are prone to infections by microbes thriving on leaf surfaces and in the insects' overwintering microhabitat.",TRUE
"Domes, arches and urchins: The skeletal architecture of echinoids (Echinodermata)","SummaryA combination of simple membrane theory and statical analysis has been used to determine how stresses are carried in echinoid skeletons. Sutures oriented circumferentially are subject principally to compression. Those forming radial zig-zags are subject to compression near the apex and tension near the ambitus. Radial and circumferential sutures in Eucidaris are equally bound with collagen fibers but in Diadema, Tripneustes, Psammechinus, Arbacia and other regular echinoids, most radial sutures are more heavily bound, and thus stronger in tension. Psammechinus, Tripneustes and several other echinoids have radial sutures thickened by ribs which increase the area of interlocking trabeculae. Ribs also increase flexural stiffness and carry a greater proportion of the stress. Further, ribs effectively draw stress from weaker areas pierced by podial pores, and increase the total load which can be sustained.Allometry indicates that regular echinoids become relatively higher at the apex as size increases, thus reducing ambital stresses. Some spatangoids with very high domes (eg Agassizia) maintain isometry, but others (eg Meoma) become flatter with size. Both holectypoids (Echinoneus) and cassiduloids (Apatopygus) maintain a constant height to diameter relationship. Flattening, and consequently ambital tensile stress, is greatest in the clypeasteroids. In this group the formation of internal buttresses which preferentially carry stress, reaches maximum development. A notable exception, however, is the high domed Clypeaster rosaceus.In this analysis it was assumed that local buckling or bending does not occur. The test of some echinoids (e.g. Diadematoida) have relatively wide sutures swathed in collagen, which allows local deformation. Others (e.g. Arbacia) have rigid sutures with reduced collagen. In Psammechinus and other members of the Order Echinoida, in addition to rib formation, inner and outer surface trabeculae are thickened so that the individual plates are stiffened. Some spatangoids (Meoma, Paleopneustes) have extensive sutural collagen, but the cassiduloid Apatopygus has collagen confined to junctions of sutures, and elsewhere the joints are strengthened and stiffened by fusion of trabeculae. Fusion of surface trabeculae is almost complete in the holectypoid, Echinoneus, and the sutures are obscured.",TRUE
Dragon fish see using chlorophyll,"Most deep-sea fish have visual pigments that are most sensitive to wavelengths around 460-490 nm, the intensity maxima of both conventional blue bioluminescence and dim residual sunlight. The predatory deep-sea dragon fish Malacosteus niger, the closely related Aristostomias sp. and Pachystomias microdon can, in addition to blue bioluminescence, also emit far-red light from suborbital photophores, which is invisible to other deep-sea animals. Whereas Aristostomias sp. enhances its long-wavelength sensitivity using visual pigments that are unusually red sensitive, we now report that M. niger attains the same result using a derivative of chlorophyll as a photosensitizer.",TRUE
"Dragonfly flight. II. Velocities, accelerations and kinematics of flapping flight.","The free flapping flight of the dragonfly Sympetrum sanguineum and the damselfly Calopteryx splendens was filmed in a large flight enclosure at 3000 frames s-1. The wingtip kinematics are described for these flights. Despite the two species being similar in size, the damselfly flew with wingbeat frequencies half those of the dragonfly. The damselfly could perform a clap and fling, and the proximity to which the wings approached each other during this manoeuvre correlated with the total force produced during the wingstroke. The dragonfly beat its wings with a set inclination of the stroke planes with respect to the londitudinal body axis; the damselfly, in contrast, showed a greater variation in this angle. Both species aligned their stroke planes to be nearly normal to the direction of the resultant force, the thrust. In order to achieve this, the dragonfly body alignment correlated with the direction of thrust. However, the damselfly body alignment was independent of the thrust direction. Velocities and accelerations were greater for the dragonfly than for the damselfly. However, non-dimensional velocities and accelerations normalised by the wingbeat periods were greater for the damselfly.",TRUE
Dragonfly wing nodus: A one-way hinge contributing to the asymmetric wing deformation.,"Dragonfly wings are highly specialized locomotor systems, which are formed by a combination of several structural components. The wing components, also known as structural elements, are responsible for the various aspects of the wing functionality. Considering the complex interactions between the wing components, modelling of the wings as a whole is only possible with inevitable huge oversimplifications. In order to overcome this difficulty, we have recently proposed a new approach to model individual components of complex wings comparatively. Here, we use this approach to study nodus, a structural element of dragonfly wings which has been less studied to date. Using a combination of several imaging techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wide-field fluorescence microscopy (WFM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scanning, we aim to characterize the spatial morphology and material composition of fore- and hindwing nodi of the dragonfly Brachythemis contaminata. The microscopy results show the presence of resilin in the nodi, which is expected to help the deformability of the wings. The computational results based on three-dimensional (3D) structural data suggest that the specific geometry of the nodus restrains its displacements when subjected to pressure on the ventral side. This effect, resulting from an interlocking mechanism, is expected to contribute to the dorso-ventral asymmetry of wing deformation and to provide a higher resistance to aerodynamic forces during the downstroke. Our results provide an important step towards better understanding of the structure-property-function relationship in dragonfly wings.STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEIn this study, we investigate the wing nodus, a specialized wing component in dragonflies. Using a combination of modern imaging techniques, we demonstrate the presence of resilin in the nodus, which is expected to facilitate the wing deformability in flight. The specific geometry of the nodus, however, seems to restrain its displacements when subjected to pressure on the ventral side. This effect, resulting from an interlocking mechanism, is suggested to contribute to dorso-ventral asymmetry of wing deformations and to provide a higher resistance to aerodynamic forces during the downstroke. Our results provide an important step towards better understanding of the structure-property-function relationship in dragonfly wings and might help to design more efficient wings for biomimetic micro-air vehicles.",TRUE
Dynamic fracture resilience of elk antler: Biomimetic inspiration for improved crashworthiness,"The antler of the North American elk has been shown to have impressive fracture resistance under quasi-static loads, but given its viscoelastic behavior and impact nature of loading, questions remain as to its mechanical, and in particular, fracture behavior under dynamic loading. Samples were tested using a unique split-pressure Hopkin-son bar (SPHB) for four-point bending experiments in order to measure the fracture toughness of this material Interestingly, the hierarchical structure of antler had a strong influence on crack propagation characteristics, and cracks tended to propagate along the osteonal growth direction, whether loaded parallel or perpendicular to the osteonal growth direction. This occurred to such a degree so as to stop all crack propagation through the sample on transverse specimens, thus inhibiting the ability to measure a valid crack initiation toughness and demonstrating the extreme resilience of antler to resist dynamic fracture. The high resilience of antler to impact loading may serve as biomimetic inspiration to future material development for crashworthiness and defense applications.",TRUE
Dynamic pigmentary and structural coloration within cephalopod chromatophore organs,"Chromatophore organs in cephalopod skin are known to produce ultra-fast changes in appearance for camouflage and communication. Light-scattering pigment granules within chromatocytes have been presumed to be the sole source of coloration in these complex organs. We report the discovery of structural coloration emanating in precise register with expanded pigmented chromatocytes. Concurrently, using an annotated squid chromatophore proteome together with microscopy, we identify a likely biochemical component of this reflective coloration as reflectin proteins distributed in sheath cells that envelop each chromatocyte. Additionally, within the chromatocytes, where the pigment resides in nanostructured granules, we find the lens protein Œ©- crystallin interfacing tightly with pigment molecules. These findings offer fresh perspectives on the intricate biophotonic interplay between pigmentary and structural coloration elements tightly co-located within the same dynamic flexible organ - a feature that may help inspire the development of new classes of engineered materials that change color and pattern.Chromatophores in cephalopod skin are known for fast changes in coloration due to light-scattering pigment granules. Here, authors demonstrate structural coloration facilitated by reflectin in sheath cells and offer insights into the interplay between structural and pigmentary coloration elements.",TRUE
"Dynamic, Non-binary Specification of Sexual State in the C.¬†elegans Nervous System","Biological sex in animals is often considered a fixed, individual-level characteristic. However, not all sex-specific features are static: for example, C.¬†elegans males (XO) can sometimes exhibit hermaphrodite (XX)-like feeding behavior [1, 2]. (C.¬†elegans hermaphrodites are somatic females that transiently produce self-sperm.) Essentially all somatic sex differences in C.¬†elegans are governed by the master regulator tra-1, whose activity is controlled by chromosomal sex and is necessary and sufficient to specify the hermaphrodite state [3]. One aspect of this state is high expression of the chemoreceptor odr-10. In hermaphrodites, high odr-10 expression promotes feeding, but in males, low odr-10 expression facilitates exploration [4]. However, males suppress this sex difference in two contexts: juvenile males exhibit high odr-10 expression and food deprivation activates odr-10 in adult males [4-6]. Remarkably, we find that both of these phenomena require tra-1. In juvenile (L3) males, tra-1 is expressed in numerous neurons; this expression diminishes as individuals mature into adulthood, a process that requires conserved regulators of sexual maturation. tra-1 remains expressed in a small number of neurons in adult males, where it likely has a permissive role in odr-10 activation. Thus, the neuronal functions of tra-1 are not limited to hermaphrodites; rather, tra-1 also acts in the male nervous system to transiently suppress a sexual dimorphism, developmentally and in response to nutritional stress. Our results show that the molecular and functional representation of sexual state in C.¬†elegans is neither static nor homogeneous, challenging traditional notions about the nature of biological sex.",TRUE
Dynamics of leg muscle function in tammar wallabies (M. eugenii) during level versus incline hopping,"SUMMARY The goal of our study was to examine whether the in vivo force-length behavior, work and elastic energy savings of distal muscle-tendon units in the legs of tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) change during level versus incline hopping. To address this question, we obtained measurements of muscle activation (via electromyography), fascicle strain (via sonomicrometry) and muscle-tendon force (via tendon buckles) from the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and plantaris (PL) muscles of tammar wallabies trained to hop on a level and an inclined (10¬∞, 17.4% grade) treadmill at two speeds (3.3 m s-1 and 4.2 m s-1). Similar patterns of muscle activation, force and fascicle strain were observed under both level and incline conditions. This also corresponded to similar patterns of limb timing and movement (duty factor, limb contact time and hopping frequency). During both level and incline hopping, the LG and PL exhibited patterns of fascicle stretch and shortening that yielded low levels of net fascicle strain [LG: level, -1.0¬±4.6% (mean ¬± s.e.m.) vs incline, 0.6¬±4.5%; PL: level, 0.1¬±1.0% vs incline, 0.4¬±1.6%] and muscle work (LG: level, -8.4¬±8.4 J kg-1 muscle vs incline, -6.8¬±7.5 J kg-1 muscle; PL: level, -2.0¬±0.6 J kg-1 muscle vs incline, -1.4¬±0.7 J kg-1 muscle). Consequently, neither muscle significantly altered its contractile dynamics to do more work during incline hopping. Whereas electromyographic (EMG) phase, duration and intensity did not differ for the LG, the PL exhibited shorter but more intense periods of activation, together with reduced EMG phase (P<0.01), during incline versus level hopping. Our results indicate that design for spring-like tendon energy savings and economical muscle force generation is key for these two distal muscle-tendon units of the tammar wallaby, and the need to accommodate changes in work associated with level versus incline locomotion is achieved by more proximal muscles of the limb.",TRUE

Effect of abiotic factors on the foraging strategy of the orb-web spider Argiope keyserlingi (Araneae: Araneidae),"Environmental conditions such as light level, background contrast and temperature might influence a spider's prey capture success and risk of predation. Thus it may often be advantageous for spiders to adjust web-building behaviour in response to variation in these environmental conditions. This hypothesis was examined in a study of the construction of webs and web decorations (conspicuous strands of silk at the hub of the web) of the orb-web spider Argiope keyserlingi. Web decorations are thought to have one or more separate functions. They may attract prey, deter predators or advertise the web to oncoming birds, thus preventing web damage. In this series of experiments, relationships between weather parameters and the construction of webs and web decorations were considered. In complementary laboratory experiments, A. keyserlingi spiders were exposed to two different light levels (700 and 90 lx), background contrasts (black and white) and temperature conditions (20 and 26¬∞C). Of the available weather parameters, only temperature was significantly related to web decorating behaviour but not to web size. In the laboratory, temperature also influenced web-decorating behaviour, and spiders in dim light (700 lx) constructed larger webs and longer decorations. Background contrast did not significantly alter web size or web decorations. These data suggest that when prey availability is reduced at low temperatures, spiders may use web decorations to attract prey to the web. Similarly, in dim light, spiders may build more and larger decorations to increase the visual signal to approaching prey or to advertise the web to oncoming birds.",TRUE
Effect of Angle on Flow-Induced Vibrations of Pinniped Vibrissae,"Two types of vibrissal surface structures, undulated and smooth, exist among pinnipeds. Most Phocidae have vibrissae with undulated surfaces, while Otariidae, Odobenidae, and a few phocid species possess vibrissae with smooth surfaces. Variations in cross-sectional profile and orientation of the vibrissae also exist between pinniped species. These factors may influence the way that the vibrissae behave when exposed to water flow. This study investigated the effect that vibrissal surface structure and orientation have on flow-induced vibrations of pinniped vibrissae. Laser vibrometry was used to record vibrations along the whisker shaft from the undulated vibrissae of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) and northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) and the smooth vibrissae of California sea lions (Zalophus californianus). Vibrations along the whisker shaft were measured in a flume tank, at three orientations (0¬∞, 45¬∞, 90¬∞) to the water flow. The results show that vibration frequency and velocity ranges were similar for both undulated and smooth vibrissae. Angle of orientation, rather than surface structure, had the greatest effect on flow-induced vibrations. Vibration velocity was up to 60 times higher when the wide, flat aspect of the whisker faced into the flow (90¬∞), compared to when the thin edge faced into the flow (0¬∞). Vibration frequency was also dependent on angle of orientation. Peak frequencies were measured up to 270 Hz and were highest at the 0¬∞ orientation for all whiskers. Furthermore, CT scanning was used to quantify the three-dimensional structure of pinniped vibrissae that may influence flow interactions. The CT data provide evidence that all vibrissae are flattened in cross-section to some extent and that differences exist in the orientation of this profile with respect to the major curvature of the hair shaft. These data support the hypothesis that a compressed cross-sectional profile may play a key role in reducing self-noise of the vibrissae.",TRUE
Effect of blood removal and infusion on gull salt gland secretion,"Summary1.The effect of blood removal and addition on salt gland secretion was studied in freshwater and seawater acclimated gulls,Larus glaucescens.2.In contrast to published reports that blood removal decreased and blood infusion increased salt gland secretion in ducks, neither blood removal nor addition had an effect on concentration or volume of salt gland secretion in gulls.",TRUE
Effects of sea hare ink secretion and its escapin-generated components on a variety of predatory fishes,"Sea hares, Aplysia californica, have a diversity of anti-predatory defenses. One is an actively released chemical defense: an ink secretion that is a mixture of two glandular products--ink from the ink gland and opaline from the opaline gland. The mechanisms of action of ink secretion and its components have recently been examined in detail against several predatory invertebrates. Our goal is to extend this mechanistic analysis to predatory vertebrates. Toward this end, the current study details the effects of ink, opaline, and one set of its components--the products of the reaction of escapin, an l-amino acid oxidase, with its natural substrates, L-lysine and L-arginine--on the palatability of food for five species of fishes: bluehead wrasses Thalassoma bifasciatum, se√±orita wrasses Oxyjulis californica, pinfish Lagodon rhomboides, mummichogs Fundulus heteroclitus, and bonnethead sharks Sphyrna tiburo. These fishes have different feeding styles, ranging from large fishes able to engulf sea hares to smaller fishes able to attack sea hares by pecking at them; and they live in a variety of habitats, including those that sea hares typically inhabit. We show that ink but not opaline significantly decreases the palatability of food for all five species, and that escapin products are mildly unpalatable to the two species of wrasses but not to the other species. These results, together with others, show that sea hare ink affects a diversity of predatory fishes, setting the stage for mechanistic studies using electrophysiological analysis of their chemosensory systems.",TRUE

Efficacy and safety of catnip (Nepeta cataria) as a novel filth fly repellent,"Catnip (Nepeta cataria) is known for its pseudo-narcotic effects on cats. Recently, it has been reported as an effective mosquito repellent against several Aedes and Culex species, both topically and spatially. Our laboratory bioassays showed that catnip essential oil (at a dosage of 20 mg) resulted in average repellency rates of 96% against stable flies, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.) and 79% against houseflies, Musca domestica (L.), respectively. This finding suggested that the application of repellent could be used as part of filth fly management. Further evaluations of catnip oil toxicity were conducted to provide a broad-spectrum safety profile of catnip oil use as a potential biting and nuisance insect repellent in urban settings. Acute oral, dermal, inhalation, primary dermal and eye irritation toxicity tests were performed. The acute oral LD(50) of catnip oil was found to be 3160 mg/kg body weight (BW) and 2710 mg/kg BW in female and male rats, respectively. The acute dermal LD50 was > 5000 mg/kg BW. The acute inhalation LD50 was observed to be > 10,000 mg/m3. Primary skin irritation tested on New Zealand white rabbits showed that catnip oil is a moderate irritant. Catnip oil was classified as practically non-irritating to the eye. In comparison with other U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-approved mosquito repellents (DEET, picaridin and p-menthane-3,8-diol), catnip oil can be considered as a relatively safe repellent, which may cause minor skin irritation.",TRUE
Efficient Atmospheric Cleansing of Oxidized Organic Trace Gases by Vegetation,"Volatiles Versus Vegetation Plants act as both global sources and sinks of highly reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Models typically treat the uptake and degradation of these compounds as if they are mostly unreactive, like other more commonly studied biogenic gases such as ozone. A study by Karl et al. (p. 816, published online 21 October) suggests that VOCs may be more reactive than expected. By monitoring six field sites representing a range of deciduous ecosystems, several oxidized VOCs were found to have high deposition fluxes. Fumigation experiments in the laboratory confirmed that leaves are capable of oxidizing these compounds, and do so through an enzymatic detoxification or stress-response mechanism. Budgets for VOC flux in the atmosphere suggests that, on a global scale, plants may take up significant levels of VOCs in polluted regions, especially in the tropics. Deciduous trees enzymatically remove oxygenated volatile organic compounds from the atmosphere. The biosphere is the major source and sink of nonmethane volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere. Gas-phase chemical reactions initiate the removal of these compounds from the atmosphere, which ultimately proceeds via deposition at the surface or direct oxidation to carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. We performed ecosystem-scale flux measurements that show that the removal of oxygenated VOC via dry deposition is substantially larger than is currently assumed for deciduous ecosystems. Laboratory experiments indicate efficient enzymatic conversion and potential up-regulation of various stress-related genes, leading to enhanced uptake rates as a response to ozone and methyl vinyl ketone exposure or mechanical wounding. A revised scheme for the uptake of oxygenated VOCs, incorporated into a global chemistry-transport model, predicts appreciable regional changes in annual dry deposition fluxes.",TRUE
Egg attachment of the asparagus beetle Crioceris asparagi to the crystalline waxy surface of Asparagus officinalis,"Plant surfaces covered with crystalline epicuticular waxes are known to be anti-adhesive, hardly wettable and preventing insect attachment. But there are insects that are capable of gluing their eggs to these surfaces by means of proteinaceous secretions. In this study, we analysed the bonding region between the eggs of Crioceris asparagi and the plant surface of Asparagus officinalis using light and cryo-scanning electron microscopy. The wettability of the plant surface by egg secretion was compared with that by Aqua Millipore water, aqueous sugar solution and chicken egg white. Furthermore, the force required to remove C. asparagi eggs from the plant surface was measured, in order to evaluate the egg's bonding strength. Mean pull-off force was 14.7 mN, which is about 8650 times higher than the egg weight. Egg glue was observed spreading over the wax crystal arrays on the plant cladophyll and wetting them. Similar wetting behaviour on the A. officinalis surface was observed for chicken egg white. Our results support the hypothesis that the mechanism of insect egg adhesion on micro- and nanostructured hydrophobic plant surfaces is related to the proteinaceous nature of adhesive secretions of insect eggs. The secretion wets superhydrophobic surfaces and after solidifying builds up a composite, consisting of the solidified glue and wax crystals, at the interface between the egg and plant cuticle.",TRUE
Egg Longevity and Time-Integrated Fertilization in a Temperate Sea Urchin (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis),"Recent field experiments have suggested that fertilization levels in sea urchins (and other broadcast spawners that release their gametes into the water column) may often be far below 100%. However, past experiments have not considered the potentially positive combined effects of an extended period of egg longevity and the release of gametes in viscous fluids (which reduces dilution rates). In a laboratory experiment, we found that eggs of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis had high viability for 2 to 3 d. Fertilization levels of eggs held in sperm-permeable egg baskets in the field and exposed to sperm slowly diffusing off a spawning male increased significantly with exposure from 15 min to 3 h. In a field survey of time-integrated fertilizations (over 24, 48, and 72 h) during natural sperm release events, eggs held in baskets accrued fertilizations over as much as 48 h and attained fairly high fertilization levels. Our results suggest that an extended period of egg longevity and the release of gametes in viscous fluids may result in higher natural fertilization levels than currently expected from short-term field experiments.",TRUE
"Eisenia fetida (Oligochaeta, Lumbricidae) activates fungal growth, triggering cellulose decomposition during vermicomposting","Cellulose is the most abundant polymer in nature and constitutes a large pool of carbon for microorganisms, the main agents responsible for soil organic matter decomposition. Cellulolysis occurs as the result of the combined action of fungi and bacteria with different requirements. Earthworms influence decomposition indirectly by affecting microbial population structure and dynamics and also directly because the guts of some species possess cellulolytic activity. Here we assess whether the earthworm Eisenia fetida (Savigny 1826) digests cellulose directly (i.e., with its associated gut microbiota) and also whether the effects of E. fetida on microbial biomass and activity lead to a change in the equilibrium between fungi and bacteria. By enhancing fungal communities, E. fetida would presumably trigger more efficient cellulose decomposition. To evaluate the role of E. fetida in cellulose decomposition, we carried out an experiment in which pig slurry, a microbial-rich substrate, was treated in small-scale vermireactors with and without earthworms. The presence of earthworms in vermireactors significantly increased the rate of cellulose decomposition (0.43 and 0.26% cellulose loss day(-1), with and without earthworms, respectively). However, the direct contribution of E. fetida to degradation of cellulose was not significant, although its presence increased microbial biomass (C(mic)) and enzyme activity (cellulase and beta-glucosidase). Surprisingly, as fungi may be part of the diet of earthworms, the activity of E. fetida triggered fungal growth during vermicomposting. We suggest that this activation is a key step leading to more intense and efficient cellulolysis during vermicomposting of organic wastes.",TRUE
Elastic energy storage in the mantis shrimp's fast predatory strike,"SUMMARY Storage of elastic energy is key to increasing the power output of many biological systems. Mantis shrimp (Stomatopoda) must store considerable elastic energy prior to their rapid raptorial strikes; however, little is known about the dynamics and location of elastic energy storage structures in this system. We used computed tomography (CT) to visualize the mineralization patterns in Gonodactylaceus falcatus and high speed videography of Odontodactylus scyllarus to observe the dynamics of spring loading. Using a materials testing apparatus, we measured the force and work required to contract the elastic structures in G. falcatus. There was a positive linear correlation between contraction force and contraction distance; alternative model tests further supported the use of a linear model. Therefore, we modeled the system as a Hookean spring. The force required to fully compress the spring was positively correlated with body mass and appendage size, but the spring constant did not scale with body size, suggesting a possible role of muscle constraints in the scaling of this system. One hypothesized elastic storage structure, the saddle, only contributed approximately 11% of the total measured force, thus suggesting that primary site of elastic energy storage is in the mineralized ventral bars found in the merus segment of the raptorial appendages. Furthermore, the intact system exhibited 81% resilience and severing the saddle resulted in a non-significant reduction to 77% resilience. The remarkable shapes and mineralization patterns that characterize the mantis shrimp's raptorial appendage further reveal a highly integrated mechanical power amplification system based on exoskeletal elastic energy storage.",TRUE
Elastic Energy Stores in Running Vertebrates,"Large mammals save much of the energy they would otherwise need for running by means of elastic structures in their legs. Kinetic and potential energy, lost at one stage of a stride, is stored temporarily as elastic strain energy and returned later in an elastic recoil. At high speeds, men and kangaroos seem to save in this way more than half the metabolic energy they would otherwise need for locomotion.It is shown by means of a generalized model that muscles and tendons could both be important as elastic energy stores. Analysis of films and force records of kangaroos hopping shows that strain energy stored while the feet are on the ground must be stored mainly distal to the knee. The principal muscles there have short fibres, and most of the storage must be in tendons. Investigation of camels shows that tendons in the feet, distal to the ankle and wrist, are especially important. The scope for elastic storage while the feet are off the groundis also considered.Though the evidence presented in this paper comes mainly from a few species, the conclusions presumably apply to large mammals in general.",TRUE
Elastic modulus of tree frog adhesive toe pads,"Previous work using an atomic force microscope in nanoindenter mode indicated that the outer, 10- to 15-Œºm thick, keratinised layer of tree frog toe pads has a modulus of elasticity equivalent to silicone rubber (5‚Äì15¬†MPa) (Scholz et al. 2009), but gave no information on the physical properties of deeper structures. In this study, micro-indentation is used to measure the stiffness of whole toe pads of the tree frog, Litoria caerulea. We show here that tree frog toe pads are amongst the softest of biological structures (effective elastic modulus 4‚Äì25¬†kPa), and that they exhibit a gradient of stiffness, being stiffest on the outside. This stiffness gradient results from the presence of a dense network of capillaries lying beneath the pad epidermis, which probably has a shock absorbing function. Additionally, we compare the physical properties (elastic modulus, work of adhesion, pull-off force) of the toe pads of immature and adult frogs.",TRUE
Elasticity of the hair cover in air-retaining Salvinia surfaces,"Immersed in water superhydrophobic surfaces (e.g., lotus) maintain thin temporary air films. In certain aquatic plants and animals, these films are thicker and more persistent. Floating ferns of the genus Salvinia show elaborated hierarchical superhydrophobic surface structures: a hairy cover of complex trichomes. In the case of S. molesta, they are eggbeater shaped and topped by hydrophilic tips, which pin the air‚Äìwater interface and prevent rupture of contact. It has been proposed that these trichomes can oscillate with the air‚Äìwater interface, when turbulences occur and thereby stabilize the air film. The deformability of such arrays of trichomes requires a certain elasticity of the structures. In this study, we determined the stiffness of the trichome coverage of S. molesta and three other Salvinia species. Our results confirm the elasticity of the trichome coverage in all investigated Salvinia species. We did not reveal a clear relationship between the time of air retention and stiffness of the trichome coverage, which means that the air retention function is additionally dependent on different parameters, e.g., the trichome shape and surface free energy. These data are not only interesting for Salvinia biology, but also important for the development of biomimetic air-retaining surfaces.",TRUE
Electrical and behavioral courtship displays in the mormyrid fish Brienomyrus brachyistius,"SUMMARY Mormyrid electric fish rely on the waveform of their electric organ discharges (EODs) for communicating species, sex, and social status, while they use the sequences of pulse intervals (SPIs) for communicating rapidly changing behavioral states and motivation. Little is known of electric signaling during courtship behavior because of two major difficulties: (1) the fish are not easily bred in captivity and (2) there is no reliable means of separating electric signals from several individuals in natural communication settings. Through simulating artificial rain conditions, we have successfully induced courtship and succeeded in breeding a mormyrid electric fish (Brienomyrus brachyistius) in the laboratory. We have also developed a system of video recording and editing combined with cross correlation analysis to precisely record and view behavior and separate EODs from two individuals in non-breeding and breeding contexts. Knowing the electrical and motor patterns during courtship allows for further exploration of topics such as mate choice and neural basis of pattern generation in these fish. Here we describe nine common motor displays and 11 SPIs. Analysis of frequency of occurrences suggests that some SPI patterns are sex and season specific. We also observed electrical duetting called `rasp matching' during courtship signaling among pairs; males and females exchange `rasps' and `bursts', respectively, in alternation. Our study employs new techniques to separate and document SPIs in the context of courtship. We show that some SPIs correlate with specific behavioral acts around the time of spawning.",TRUE
Electrical signals control wound healing through phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-Œ≥ and PTEN,"Wound healing is essential for maintaining the integrity of multicellular organisms. In every species studied, disruption of an epithelial layer instantaneously generates endogenous electric fields, which have been proposed to be important in wound healing. The identity of signalling pathways that guide both cell migration to electric cues and electric-field-induced wound healing have not been elucidated at a genetic level. Here we show that electric fields, of a strength equal to those detected endogenously, direct cell migration during wound healing as a prime directional cue. Manipulation of endogenous wound electric fields affects wound healing in vivo. Electric stimulation triggers activation of Src and inositol‚Äìphospholipid signalling, which polarizes in the direction of cell migration. Notably, genetic disruption of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-Œ≥ (PI(3)KŒ≥) decreases electric-field-induced signalling and abolishes directed movements of healing epithelium in response to electric signals. Deletion of the tumour suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) enhances signalling and electrotactic responses. These data identify genes essential for electrical-signal-induced wound healing and show that PI(3)KŒ≥ and PTEN control electrotaxis.",TRUE
Electron transfer in syntrophic communities of anaerobic bacteria and archaea,"Interspecies electron transfer is a key process in methanogenic and sulphate-reducing environments. Bacteria and archaea that live in syntrophic communities take advantage of the metabolic abilities of their syntrophic partner to overcome energy barriers and break down compounds that they cannot digest by themselves. Here, we review the transfer of hydrogen and formate between bacteria and archaea that helps to sustain growth in syntrophic methanogenic communities. We also describe the process of reverse electron transfer, which is a key requirement in obligately syntrophic interactions. Anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to sulphate reduction is also carried out by syntrophic communities of bacteria and archaea but, as we discuss, the exact mechanism of this syntrophic interaction is not yet understood.",TRUE
Emergency networking: famine relief in ant colonies,"Resource distribution is fundamental to social organization, but it poses a dilemma. How to facilitate the spread of useful resources but restrict harmful substances? This dilemma reaches a zenith in famine relief. Survival depends on distributing food fast but that could increase vulnerability to poisons. We tested how Temnothorax albipennis ants solve this dilemma in the distribution of honey solution after 48 h of starvation in four colonies with individually marked workers. We constructed the complete network of liquid food transmission (trophallaxis) between individuals. Within the first 30 min of famine relief, 95% of the workers received food and the distribution rate was an order of magnitude faster compared to the controls. We tested the assumptions of a simple analytical model that best fitted our data. Good mixing during famine relief was facilitated by the movement of internal workers away from the brood pile and the movement of foragers with food away from the nest entrance. This is intriguing because T. albipennis workers have spatial fidelity zones and in the controls internal and external workers were segregated. We discovered that colony vulnerability to poisons during famine relief might be mitigated by: (1) the dilution of food from the same source through mixing, (2) the concentration of food in workers positioned midway between the colony centre and its periphery and (3) the existence of living 'silos'. The latter are expendable foragers, who stay inside the nest and store food during famine relief, thus acting as potential disposable testers for food toxicity. ¬© 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",TRUE
Encoding Membrane-Potential-Based Memory within a Microbial Community.,"Cellular membrane potential plays a key role in the formation and retrieval of memories in the metazoan brain, but it remains unclear whether such memory can also be encoded in simpler organisms like bacteria. Here, we show that single-cell-level memory patterns can be imprinted in bacterial biofilms by light-induced changes in the membrane potential. We demonstrate that transient optical perturbations generate a persistent and robust potassium-channel-mediated change in the membrane potential of bacteria within the biofilm. The light-exposed cells respond in an anti-phase manner, relative to unexposed cells, to both natural and induced oscillations in extracellular ion concentrations. This anti-phase response, which persists for hours following the transient optical stimulus, enables a direct single-cell resolution visualization of spatial memory patterns within the biofilm. The ability to encode robust and persistent membrane-potential-based memory patterns could enable computations within prokaryotic communities and suggests a parallel between neurons and bacteria.",TRUE
Energetic Cost of Locomotion in Kangaroos,"THE hopping of kangaroos is reminiscent of a bouncing ball or the action of a pogo stick. This suggests a significant storage and recovery of energy in elastic elements. One might surmise that the kangaroo's first hop would require a large amount of energy whereas subsequent hops could rely extensively on elastic rebound. If this were the case, then the kangaroo's unusual saltatory mode of locomotion should be an energetically inexpensive way to move.",TRUE
Energy saving in flight formation,"Many species of large bird fly together in formation, perhaps because flight power demands and energy expenditure can be reduced when the birds fly at an optimal spacing, or because orientation is improved by communication within groups. We have measured heart rates as an estimate of energy expenditure in imprinted great white pelicans (Pelecanus onocrotalus) trained to fly in 'V' formation, and show that these birds save a significant amount of energy by flying in formation. This advantage is probably a principal reason for the evolution of flight formation in large birds that migrate in groups.",TRUE
"Energy storage and synchronisation of hind leg movements during jumping in planthopper insects (Hemiptera, Issidae)","SUMMARY The hind legs of Issus (Hemiptera, Issidae) move in the same plane underneath the body, an arrangement that means they must also move synchronously to power jumping. Moreover, they move so quickly that energy must be stored before a jump and then released suddenly. High speed imaging and analysis of the mechanics of the proximal joints of the hind legs show that mechanical mechanisms ensure both synchrony of movements and energy storage. The hind trochantera move first in jumping and are synchronised to within 30 Œºs. Synchrony is achieved by mechanical interactions between small protrusions from each trochantera which fluoresce bright blue under specific wavelengths of ultra-violet light and which touch at the midline when the legs are cocked before a jump. In dead Issus, a depression force applied to a cocked hind leg, or to the tendon of its trochanteral depressor muscle causes a simultaneous depression of both hind legs. The protrusion of the hind leg that moves first nudges the other hind leg so that both move synchronously. Contractions of the trochanteral depressor muscles that precede a jump bend the metathoracic pleural arches of the internal skeleton. Large areas of these bow-shaped structures fluoresce bright blue in ultraviolet light, and the intensity of this fluorescence depends on the pH of the bathing saline. These are key signatures of the rubber-like protein resilin. The remainder of a pleural arch consists of stiff cuticle. Bending these composite structures stores energy and their recoil powers jumping.",TRUE
Energy transfer and trapping in photosystem I.,"The primary processes in all photosynthetic systems involve the absorption of energy from (sun) light by chromophores in a light harvesting antenna, and the subsequent transfer of this energy to a reaction centre (RC) site where the energy is `trapped' by means of a stable charge separation. Photosystem (PS) I is one of two such photosystems in oxygenic photosynthesis. When co-operating with PS II it uses the energy of light to transfer electrons from plastocyanin or soluble cytochrome c6 to ferredoxin and eventually to NADP¬á. In an alternative pathway, the electrons from ferredoxin are transferred back to plastocyanin via the cytochrome b6f complex. This cyclic electron transport, which does not require the input of free energy by PS II, results in a transmembrane electrochemical gradient that can be used to produce ATP. In plants and green algae the PS I complex consists of two separable functional units: the PS I core, and the light harvesting complex (LHC) I peripheral antenna. The PS I complex in cyanobacteria does not possess the peripheral LHCI antenna, but since the PS I core complexes of cyanobacteria bear a large resemblance to the core complex of plants, a direct comparison of the energy transfer and trapping properties of these complexes is justi¬¢ed [1,2].",TRUE
Enhanced visual fields in hammerhead sharks,"SUMMARY Several factors that influence the evolution of the unusual head morphology of hammerhead sharks (family Sphyrnidae) are proposed but few are empirically tested. In this study we tested the ‚Äòenhanced binocular field‚Äô hypothesis (that proposes enhanced frontal binocularity) by comparison of the visual fields of three hammerhead species: the bonnethead shark, Sphyrna tiburo, the scalloped hammerhead shark, Sphyrna lewini, and the winghead shark, Eusphyra blochii, with that of two carcharhinid species: the lemon shark, Negaprion brevirostris, and the blacknose shark, Carcharhinus acronotus. Additionally, eye rotation and head yaw were quantified to determine if species compensate for large blind areas anterior to the head. The winghead shark possessed the largest anterior binocular overlap (48 deg.) and was nearly four times larger than that of the lemon (10 deg.) and blacknose (11 deg.) sharks. The binocular overlap in the scalloped hammerhead sharks (34 deg.) was greater than the bonnethead sharks (13 deg.) and carcharhinid species; however, the bonnethead shark did not differ from the carcharhinids. These results indicate that binocular overlap has increased with lateral head expansion in hammerhead sharks. The hammerhead species did not demonstrate greater eye rotation in the anterior or posterior direction. However, both the scalloped hammerhead and bonnethead sharks exhibited greater head yaw during swimming (16.9 deg. and 15.6 deg., respectively) than the lemon (15.1 deg.) and blacknose (15.0 deg.) sharks, indicating a behavioral compensation for the anterior blind area. This study illustrates the larger binocular overlap in hammerhead species relative to their carcharhinid sister taxa and is consistent with the ‚Äòenhanced binocular field‚Äô hypothesis.",TRUE

Entrapment of bed bugs by leaf trichomes inspires microfabrication of biomimetic surfaces,"Resurgence in bed bug infestations and widespread pesticide resistance have greatly renewed interest in the development of more sustainable, environmentally friendly methods to manage bed bugs. Historically, in Eastern Europe, bed bugs were entrapped by leaves from bean plants, which were then destroyed; this purely physical entrapment was related to microscopic hooked hairs (trichomes) on the leaf surfaces. Using scanning electron microscopy and videography, we documented the capture mechanism: the physical impaling of bed bug feet (tarsi) by these trichomes. This is distinct from a Velcro-like mechanism of non-piercing entanglement, which only momentarily holds the bug without sustained capture. Struggling, trapped bed bugs are impaled by trichomes on several legs and are unable to free themselves. Only specific, mechanically vulnerable locations on the bug tarsi are pierced by the trichomes, which are located at effective heights and orientations for bed bug entrapment despite a lack of any evolutionary association. Using bean leaves as templates, we microfabricated surfaces indistinguishable in geometry from the real leaves, including the trichomes, using polymers with material properties similar to plant cell walls. These synthetic surfaces snag the bed bugs temporarily but do not hinder their locomotion as effectively as real leaves.",TRUE
Environmental Genomics Reveals a Single-Species Ecosystem Deep Within Earth,"DNA from low-biodiversity fracture water collected at 2.8-kilometer depth in a South African gold mine was sequenced and assembled into a single, complete genome. This bacterium, Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator, composes >99.9% of the microorganisms inhabiting the fluid phase of this particular fracture. Its genome indicates a motile, sporulating, sulfate-reducing, chemoautotrophic thermophile that can fix its own nitrogen and carbon by using machinery shared with archaea. Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator is capable of an independent life-style well suited to long-term isolation from the photosphere deep within Earth's crust and offers an example of a natural ecosystem that appears to have its biological component entirely encoded within a single genome.",TRUE
"Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) family: Phylogeny, structure-function, tissue distribution, and associated inherited diseases.","The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is composed of three homologous subunits and allows the flow of Na(+) ions across high resistance epithelia, maintaining body salt and water homeostasis. ENaC dependent reabsorption of Na(+) in the kidney tubules regulates extracellular fluid (ECF) volume and blood pressure by modulating osmolarity. In multi-ciliated cells, ENaC is located in cilia and plays an essential role in the regulation of epithelial surface liquid volume necessary for cilial transport of mucus and gametes in the respiratory and reproductive tracts respectively. The subunits that form ENaC (named as alpha, beta, gamma and delta, encoded by genes SCNN1A, SCNN1B, SCNN1G, and SCNN1D) are members of the ENaC/Degenerin superfamily. The earliest appearance of ENaC orthologs is in the genomes of the most ancient vertebrate taxon, Cyclostomata (jawless vertebrates) including lampreys, followed by earliest representatives of Gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates) including cartilaginous sharks. Among Euteleostomi (bony vertebrates), Actinopterygii (ray finned-fishes) branch has lost ENaC genes. Yet, most animals in the Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish) branch including Tetrapoda, amphibians and amniotes (lizards, crocodiles, birds, and mammals), have four ENaC paralogs. We compared the sequences of ENaC orthologs from 20 species and established criteria for the identification of ENaC orthologs and paralogs, and their distinction from other members of the ENaC/Degenerin superfamily, especially ASIC family. Differences between ENaCs and ASICs are summarized in view of their physiological functions and tissue distributions. Structural motifs that are conserved throughout vertebrate ENaCs are highlighted. We also present a comparative overview of the genotype-phenotype relationships in inherited diseases associated with ENaC mutations, including multisystem pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA1B), Liddle syndrome, cystic fibrosis-like disease and essential hypertension.",TRUE
Epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) are uniformly distributed on motile cilia in the oviduct and the respiratory airways,"Epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) are located on the apical surface of cells and funnel Na+ ions from the lumen into the cell. ENaC function also regulates extracellular fluid volume as water flows across membranes accompanying Na+ ions to maintain osmolarity. To examine the sites of expression and intracellular localization of ENaC, we generated polyclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain of human Œ±-ENaC subunit that we expressed in E. coli. Three-dimensional (3D) confocal microscopy of immunofluorescence using these antibodies for the first time revealed that ENaCs are uniformly distributed on the ciliary surface in all epithelial cells with motile cilia lining the bronchus in human lung and female reproductive tract, all along the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube, the ampulla and rare cells in the uterine glands. Quantitative analysis indicated that cilia increase cell surface area >70-fold and the amount of ENaC on cilia is >1,000-fold higher than on non-ciliated cell surface. These findings indicate that ENaC functions as a regulator of the osmolarity of the periciliary fluid bathing the cilia. In contrast to ENaC, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) that channels chloride ions from the cytoplasm to the lumen is located mainly on the apical side, but not on cilia. The cilial localization of ENaC requires reevaluation of the mechanisms of action of CFTR and other modulators of ENaC function. ENaC on motile cilia should be essential for diverse functions of motile cilia, such as germ cell transport, fertilization, implantation, clearance of respiratory airways and cell migration.",TRUE
Epoxide-Opening Cascades Promoted by Water,"Selectivity rules in organic chemistry have been inferred largely from nonaqueous environments. In contrast, enzymes operate in water, and the chemical effect of the medium change remains only partially understood. Structural characterization of the ‚Äúladder‚Äù polyether marine natural products raised a puzzle that persisted for 20 years: Although the stereochemistry of adjacent tetrahydropyran (THP) cycles would seem to arise from a biosynthetic cascade of epoxide-opening reactions, experience in organic solvents argued consistently that such a pathway would be kinetically disfavored. We report that neutral water acts as an optimal promoter for the requisite ring-opening selectivity, once a single templating THP is appended to a chain of epoxides. This strategy offers a high-yielding route to the naturally occurring ladder core and highlights the likely importance of aqueous-medium effects in underpinning certain noteworthy enzymatic selectivities.",TRUE
"Evaluating the social networks of four flocks of captive flamingos over a five-year period: Temporal, environmental, group and health influences on assortment","Flamingos are well known for their gregarious habits and aggregations in large flocks, but evaluation of the mechanisms behind social grouping remain poorly understood. Captive birds provide a useful model for investigating aspects of social choice in highly gregarious, long-lived species. Animals invest in social relationships that convey fitness benefits and bonds can be long-lasting. For some species, field-based measurement of social networks can be difficult. Captive populations therefore provide a useful alternative for measuring social choices. Data were collected on flamingos at WWT Slimbridge Wetland Centre from 2013 to 2016 and compared to data from 2012. For three flocks, associations were analysed along with individual foot health scores to identify any relationship between health and social behaviour. Long-term partnerships were present in all flocks; preferred associates noted in 2012 were present in 2016. Matrix correlations across years were positive; arrangements of dyads, trios and quartets with higher ties strengths were visible at the beginning and end of the study. Both male-male and female-female bonds were stable over time. All flamingos were more frequently seen socialising than solitary; those in the largest flock showed the highest occurrence of social behaviour (irrespective of enclosure size differences). The number of connections realised from all available within a network was significantly influenced by season. Foot health did not predict associations in these three flamingo networks. Our results indicate that flamingo societies are complex (i.e. formed of long-standing preferential partnerships and not loose, random connections) and the impact of flock size and environment on sociality should be investigated further. These results are helpful for those working with captive flamingos to consider the number of birds housed so that an array of opportunities for choice of associate and/or breeding partner are available in zoo-housed flocks.",TRUE
Evidence for a vertebrate catapult: elastic energy storage in the plantaris tendon during frog jumping,"Anuran jumping is one of the most powerful accelerations in vertebrate locomotion. Several species are hypothesized to use a catapult-like mechanism to store and rapidly release elastic energy, producing power outputs far beyond the capability of muscle. Most evidence for this mechanism comes from measurements of whole-body power output; the decoupling of joint motion and muscle shortening expected in a catapult-like mechanism has not been demonstrated. We used high-speed marker-based biplanar X-ray cinefluoroscopy to quantify plantaris muscle fascicle strain and ankle joint motion in frogs in order to test for two hallmarks of a catapult mechanism: (i) shortening of fascicles prior to joint movement (during tendon stretch), and (ii) rapid joint movement during the jump without rapid muscle-shortening (during tendon recoil). During all jumps, muscle fascicles shortened by an average of 7.8 per cent (54% of total strain) prior to joint movement, stretching the tendon. The subsequent period of initial joint movement and high joint angular acceleration occurred with minimal muscle fascicle length change, consistent with the recoil of the elastic tendon. These data support the plantaris longus tendon as a site of elastic energy storage during frog jumping, and demonstrate that catapult mechanisms may be employed even in sub-maximal jumps.",TRUE
Evidence for an elastic projection mechanism in the chameleon tongue,"To capture prey, chameleons ballistically project their tongues as far as 1.5 body lengths with accelerations of up to 500 m s‚äÉ‚Äì2. At the core of a chameleon's tongue is a cylindrical tongue skeleton surrounded by the accelerator muscle. Previously, the cylindrical accelerator muscle was assumed to power tongue projection directly during the actual fast projection of the tongue. However, high‚Äìspeed recordings of Chamaeleo melleri and C. pardalis reveal that peak powers of 3000 W kg‚äÉ‚Äì1 are necessary to generate the observed accelerations, which exceed the accelerator muscle's capacity by at least five‚Äì to 10‚Äìfold. Extrinsic structures might power projection via the tongue skeleton. High‚Äìspeed fluoroscopy suggests that they contribute less than 10% of the required peak instantaneous power. Thus, the projection power must be generated predominantly within the tongue, and an energy‚Äìstorage‚Äìand‚Äìrelease mechanism must be at work. The key structure in the projection mechanism is probably a cylindrical connective‚Äìtissue layer, which surrounds the entoglossal process and was previously suggested to act as lubricating tissue. This tissue layer comprises at least 10 sheaths that envelop the entoglossal process. The outer portion connects anteriorly to the accelerator muscle and the inner portion to the retractor structures. The sheaths contain helical arrays of collagen fibres. Prior to projection, the sheaths are longitudinally loaded by the combined radial contraction and hydrostatic lengthening of the accelerator muscle, at an estimated mean power of 144 W kg‚äÉ‚Äì1 in C. melleri. Tongue projection is triggered as the accelerator muscle and the loaded portions of the sheaths start to slide over the tip of the entoglossal process. The springs relax radially while pushing off the rounded tip of the entoglossal process, making the elastic energy stored in the helical fibres available for a simultaneous forward acceleration of the tongue pad, accelerator muscle and retractor structures. The energy release continues as the multilayered spring slides over the tip of the smooth and lubricated entoglossal process. This sliding‚Äìspring theory predicts that the sheaths deliver most of the instantaneous power required for tongue projection. The release power of the sliding tubular springs exceeds the work rate of the accelerator muscle by at least a factor of 10 because the elastic‚Äìenergy release occurs much faster than the loading process. Thus, we have identified a unique catapult mechanism that is very different from standard engineering designs. Our morphological and kinematic observations, as well as the available literature data, are consistent with the proposed mechanism of tongue projection, although experimental tests of the sheath strain and the lubrication of the entoglossal process are currently beyond our technical scope.",TRUE

Evidence for self-cleaning in fluid-based smooth and hairy adhesive systems of insects,"SUMMARY Insects possess adhesive organs that allow attachment to diverse surfaces. Efficient adhesion must be retained throughout their lifetime even when pads are exposed to contamination. Many insects groom their adhesive structures, but it is possible that self-cleaning properties also play an important role. We measured attachment forces of insect pads on glass after contamination with microspheres and found that both smooth pads (stick insects: Carausius morosus) and hairy pads (dock beetles: Gastrophysa viridula) exhibit self-cleaning. Contaminated pads recovered high levels of adhesion after only eight simulated steps; this was accompanied by the deposition of spheres. Self-cleaning was strongly enhanced by shear movements, and only beetle pads showed the ability to self-clean during purely perpendicular pull-offs. Hairy pads also self-cleaned more efficiently than smooth pads for both large (45 Œºm) and small (1 Œºm) particle sizes. However, the beetles' self-cleaning was not superior to smooth pads when contaminated with 10-Œºm beads. This limitation of self-cleaning is explained by the coincidence of bead diameter and inter-seta distance, which caused beads to remain trapped in between setae.",TRUE
Evidence for self-cleaning in gecko setae.,"A tokay gecko can cling to virtually any surface and support its body mass with a single toe by using the millions of keratinous setae on its toe pads. Each seta branches into hundreds of 200-nm spatulae that make intimate contact with a variety of surface profiles. We showed previously that the combined surface area of billions of spatulae maximizes van der Waals interactions to generate large adhesive and shear forces. Geckos are not known to groom their feet yet retain their stickiness for months between molts. How geckos manage to keep their feet clean while walking about with sticky toes has remained a puzzle until now. Although self-cleaning by water droplets occurs in plant and animal surfaces, no adhesive has been shown to self-clean. In the present study, we demonstrate that gecko setae are a self-cleaning adhesive. Geckos with dirty feet recovered their ability to cling to vertical surfaces after only a few steps. Self-cleaning occurred in arrays of setae isolated from the gecko. Contact mechanical models suggest that self-cleaning occurs by an energetic disequilibrium between the adhesive forces attracting a dirt particle to the substrate and those attracting the same particle to one or more spatulae. We propose that the property of self-cleaning is intrinsic to the setal nanostructure and therefore should be replicable in synthetic adhesive materials in the future.",TRUE
Evidence for trans-generational medication in nature.,"Parasites pose a serious threat to host fitness, and natural selection should favour host traits that reduce infection or disease symptoms. Here, we provide the first evidence of trans-generational medication, in which animals actively use medicine to mitigate disease in their offspring. We studied monarch butterflies and their virulent protozoan parasites, and found that neither caterpillars nor adult butterflies could cure themselves of disease. Instead, adult butterflies preferentially laid their eggs on toxic plants that reduced parasite growth and disease in their offspring caterpillars. It has often been suggested that sick animals may use medication to cure themselves of disease, but evidence for the use of medication in nature has so far been scarce. Our results provide evidence that infected animals may indeed use medicine as a defence against parasites, and that such medication may target an individual's offspring rather than the individual itself.",TRUE
Evidence for wavelike energy transfer through quantum coherence in photosynthetic systems,"Photosynthetic complexes are exquisitely tuned to capture solar light efficiently, and then transmit the excitation energy to reaction centres, where long term energy storage is initiated. The energy transfer mechanism is often described by semiclassical models that invoke ‚Äòhopping‚Äô of excited-state populations along discrete energy levels. Two-dimensional Fourier transform electronic spectroscopy has mapped these energy levels and their coupling in the Fenna‚ÄìMatthews‚ÄìOlson (FMO) bacteriochlorophyll complex, which is found in green sulphur bacteria and acts as an energy ‚Äòwire‚Äô connecting a large peripheral light-harvesting antenna, the chlorosome, to the reaction centre. The spectroscopic data clearly document the dependence of the dominant energy transport pathways on the spatial properties of the excited-state wavefunctions of the whole bacteriochlorophyll complex. But the intricate dynamics of quantum coherence, which has no classical analogue, was largely neglected in the analyses‚Äîeven though electronic energy transfer involving oscillatory populations of donors and acceptors was first discussed more than 70 years ago, and electronic quantum beats arising from quantum coherence in photosynthetic complexes have been predicted and indirectly observed. Here we extend previous two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy investigations of the FMO bacteriochlorophyll complex, and obtain direct evidence for remarkably long-lived electronic quantum coherence playing an important part in energy transfer processes within this system. The quantum coherence manifests itself in characteristic, directly observable quantum beating signals among the excitons within the Chlorobium tepidum FMO complex at 77‚ÄâK. This wavelike characteristic of the energy transfer within the photosynthetic complex can explain its extreme efficiency, in that it allows the complexes to sample vast areas of phase space to find the most efficient path.",TRUE
Evidence that dimethyl sulfide facilitates a tritrophic mutualism between marine primary producers and top predators,"Significance This study demonstrates that dimethyl sulfide, a chemical cue involved in global climate regulation, mediates a tritrophic mutualistic interaction between marine apex predators and primary producers. Our results imply that marine top predators play a critical role in maintaining both ocean health and global climate. Our results highlight the need for more collaboration and discussion between micro- and macroscale biologists working on global issues in the Southern Ocean. Tritrophic mutualistic interactions have been best studied in plant‚Äìinsect systems. During these interactions, plants release volatiles in response to herbivore damage, which, in turn, facilitates predation on primary consumers or benefits the primary producer by providing nutrients. Here we explore a similar interaction in the Southern Ocean food web, where soluble iron limits primary productivity. Dimethyl sulfide has been studied in the context of global climate regulation and is an established foraging cue for marine top predators. We present evidence that procellariiform seabird species that use dimethyl sulfide as a foraging cue selectively forage on phytoplankton grazers. Their contribution of beneficial iron recycled to marine phytoplankton via excretion suggests a chemically mediated link between marine top predators and oceanic primary production.",TRUE
Evolution of restraint in a structured rock‚Äìpaper‚Äìscissors community,"It is not immediately clear how costly behavior that benefits others evolves by natural selection. By saving on inherent costs, individuals that do not contribute socially have a selective advantage over altruists if both types receive equal benefits. Restrained consumption of a common resource is a form of altruism. The cost of this kind of prudent behavior is that restrained individuals give up resources to less-restrained individuals. The benefit of restraint is that better resource management may prolong the persistence of the group. One way to dodge the problem of defection is for altruists to interact disproportionately with other altruists. With limited dispersal, restrained individuals persist because of interaction with like types, whereas it is the unrestrained individuals that must face the negative long-term consequences of their rapacity. Here, we study the evolution of restraint in a community of three competitors exhibiting a nontransitive (rock‚Äìpaper‚Äìscissors) relationship. The nontransitivity ensures a form of negative feedback, whereby improvement in growth of one competitor has the counterintuitive consequence of lowering the density of that improved player. This negative feedback generates detrimental long-term consequences for unrestrained growth. Using both computer simulations and evolution experiments with a nontransitive community of Escherichia coli, we find that restrained growth can evolve under conditions of limited dispersal in which negative feedback is present. This research, thus, highlights a set of ecological conditions sufficient for the evolution of one form of altruism.",TRUE
Evolution of the dragonfly head-arresting system,"The arrester or fixation system of the head in adult Odonata is unique among arthropods. This system involves the organs of two body segments: the head and the neck. It consists of a skeleton‚Äìmuscle apparatus that sets the arrester parts in motion. The parts comprise formations covered with complicated microstructures: fields of microtrichia on the rear surface of the head and post‚Äìcervical sclerites of the neck. The arrester immobilizes the head during feeding or when the dragonfly is in tandem flight. Thus, it may serve as an adaptation to save the head from violent mechanical disturbance and to stabilize gaze in a variety of behavioural situations. This study shows the evolutionary trend of the arrester in the order Odonata by using scanning electron microscopy and measurements of arrester structures in 227 species from 26 odonate families.

Evolution of the metathoracic tympanal ear and its mesothoracic homologue in the Macrolepidoptera (Insecta),"Abstract‚ÄÇTwo independent methods of comparison, serial homology and phylogenetic character mapping, are employed to investigate the evolutionary origin of the noctuoid moth (Noctuoidea) ear sensory organ. First, neurobiotin and Janus green B staining techniques are used to describe a novel mesothoracic chordotonal organ in the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, which is shown to be serially homologous to the noctuoid metathoracic tympanal organ. This chordotonal organ comprises a proximal scolopidial region with three bipolar sensory cells, and a long flexible strand (composed of attachment cells) that connects peripherally to an unspecialized membrane ventral to the axillary cord of the fore-wing. Homology to the tympanal chordotonal organ in the Noctuoidea is proposed from anatomical comparisons of the meso- and metathoracic nerve branches and their corresponding peripheral attachment sites. Second, the general structure (noting sensory cell numbers, gross anatomy, and location of peripheral attachment sites) of both meso- and metathoracic organs is surveyed in 23 species representing seven superfamilies of the Lepidoptera. The structure of the wing-hinge chordotonal organ in both thoracic segments was found to be remarkably conserved in all superfamilies of the Macrolepidoptera examined except the Noctuoidea, where fewer than three cells occur in the metathoracic ear (one cell in representatives of the Notodontidae and two cells in those of other families examined), and at the mesothoracic wing-hinge (two cells) in the Notodontidae only. By mapping cell numbers onto current phylogenies of the Macrolepidoptera, we demonstrate that the three-celled wing-hinge chordotonal organ, believed to be a wing proprioceptor, represents the plesiomorphic state from which the tympanal organ in the Noctuoidea evolved. This ‚Äôtrend toward simplicity‚Äô in the noctuoid ear contrasts an apparent ‚Äôtrend toward complexity‚Äô in several other insect hearing organs where atympanate homologues have been studied. The advantages to having fewer rather than more cells in the moth ear, which functions primarily to detect the echolocation calls of bats, is discussed.",TRUE
Evolution-guided discovery of antibiotics that inhibit peptidoglycan remodelling,"Addressing the ongoing antibiotic crisis requires the discovery of compounds with novel mechanisms of action that are capable of treating drug-resistant infections 1 . Many antibiotics are sourced from specialized metabolites produced by bacteria, particularly those of the Actinomycetes family 2 . Although actinomycete extracts have traditionally been screened using activity-based platforms, this approach has become unfavourable owing to the frequent rediscovery of known compounds. Genome sequencing of actinomycetes reveals an untapped reservoir of biosynthetic gene clusters, but prioritization is required to predict which gene clusters may yield promising new chemical matter 2 . Here we make use of the phylogeny of biosynthetic genes along with the lack of known resistance determinants to predict divergent members of the glycopeptide family of antibiotics that are likely to possess new biological activities. Using these predictions, we uncovered two members of a new functional class of glycopeptide antibiotics‚Äîthe known glycopeptide antibiotic complestatin and a newly discovered compound we call corbomycin‚Äîthat have a novel mode of action. We show that by binding to peptidoglycan, complestatin and corbomycin block the action of autolysins‚Äîessential peptidoglycan hydrolases that are required for remodelling of the cell wall during growth. Corbomycin and complestatin have low levels of resistance development and are effective in reducing bacterial burden in a mouse model of skin MRSA infection. The glycopeptide antibiotic-related compounds complestatin and corbomycin function by binding to peptidoglycan and blocking the action of autolysins‚Äîpeptidoglycan hydrolase enzymes that remodel the cell wall during growth.",TRUE
Evolutionary diverse Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Old Yellow Enzymes reveal distinctive catalytic properties and potential for whole-cell biotransformations,"Abstract Old Yellow Enzymes (OYEs) selectively reduce carbon‚Äëcarbon double bonds of a broad range of substrates with excellent stereoselectivity. Current challenges of their application in bio-based industrial processes are the cost-efficient regeneration of the nicotinamide co-substrate and expanding the range of industrially relevant substrates. Microalgae represent a rich and mostly untapped source for OYEs with novel catalytic properties and are promising whole-cell factories that regenerate nicotinamide by photosynthesis. By comparative phylogenetics, we identified 20 putative OYEs in eleven algal species. Three recombinant OYEs from the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrOYEs) reveal diverse biocatalytic properties and potential for enzyme optimization. High substrate conversion activities of living algal wild type and mutant cells linked the biocatalytic profiles to in vivo functionality and demonstrate the potential of microalgae as sources for distinctive OYE activities and for light-driven biotransformations.",TRUE

Existence and functions of a kisspeptin neuropeptide signaling system in a non-chordate deuterostome species,"The kisspeptin system is a central modulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in vertebrates. Its existence outside the vertebrate lineage remains largely unknown. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the kisspeptin system in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus. The gene encoding the kisspeptin precursor generates two mature neuropeptides, AjKiss1a and AjKiss1b. The receptors for these neuropeptides, AjKissR1 and AjKissR2, are strongly activated by synthetic A. japonicus and vertebrate kisspeptins, triggering a rapid intracellular mobilization of Ca2+, followed by receptor internalization. AjKissR1 and AjKissR2 share similar intracellular signaling pathways via GŒ±q/PLC/PKC/MAPK cascade, when activated by C-terminal decapeptide. The A. japonicus kisspeptin system functions in multiple tissues that are closely related to seasonal reproduction and metabolism. Overall, our findings uncover for the first time the existence and function of the kisspeptin system in a non-chordate species and provide new evidence to support the ancient origin of intracellular signaling and physiological functions that are mediated by this molecular system.",TRUE
Exopolymer alteration of physical properties of sea ice and implications for ice habitability and biogeochemistry in a warmer Arctic,"The physical properties of Arctic sea ice determine its habitability. Whether ice-dwelling organisms can change those properties has rarely been addressed. Following discovery that sea ice contains an abundance of gelatinous extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), we examined the effects of algal EPS on the microstructure and salt retention of ice grown from saline solutions containing EPS from a culture of the sea-ice diatom, Melosira arctica. We also experimented with xanthan gum and with EPS from a culture of the cold-adapted bacterium Colwellia psychrerythraea strain 34H. Quantitative microscopic analyses of the artificial ice containing Melosira EPS revealed convoluted ice-pore morphologies of high fractal dimension, mimicking features found in EPS-rich coastal sea ice, whereas EPS-free (control) ice featured much simpler pore geometries. A heat-sensitive glycoprotein fraction of Melosira EPS accounted for complex pore morphologies. Although all tested forms of EPS increased bulk ice salinity (by 11‚Äì59%) above the controls, ice containing native Melosira EPS retained the most salt. EPS effects on ice and pore microstructure improve sea ice habitability, survivability, and potential for increased primary productivity, even as they may alter the persistence and biogeochemical imprint of sea ice on the surface ocean in a warming climate.",TRUE
Experimental and theoretical quantification of the development of damage in fatigue tests of bone and antler.,"This study concerns the development of damage (as measured by a reduction in elastic modulus) in two kinds of bones differing considerably in their degrees of mineralisation: laminar bone from bovine femur and osteonal bone from red deer antler. Antler bone is much tougher than 'ordinary' bone and its failure properties have been investigated in: (i) monotonic tensile tests and (ii) creep rupture experiments. Tensile fatigue is another way of examining how damage develops in bone. The development of damage in the present fatigue tests was non-linear with the cycle number, the degree of non-linearity was dependent on the level of stress and followed a clearly different course for bone and antler. Antler was a more damage-tolerant material, being able to achieve a reduction in the final modulus of elasticity, just prior to failure, three times greater than 'ordinary' bone. The evolution of damage is quantified by an empirical and a graphical method and by the use of Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) expressions. The CDM method shows important conditions, found in antler, but not in bone, that seen necessary for achieving stable fractures and consequently producing very tough materials.",TRUE
Experimental Studies and Dynamics Modeling Analysis of the Swimming and Diving of Whirligig Beetles (Coleoptera: Gyrinidae),"Whirligig beetles (Coleoptera, Gyrinidae) can fly through the air, swiftly swim on the surface of water, and quickly dive across the air-water interface. The propulsive efficiency of the species is believed to be one of the highest measured for a thrust generating apparatus within the animal kingdom. The goals of this research were to understand the distinctive biological mechanisms that allow the beetles to swim and dive, while searching for potential bio-inspired robotics applications. Through static and dynamic measurements obtained using a combination of microscopy and high-speed imaging, parameters associated with the morphology and beating kinematics of the whirligig beetle's legs in swimming and diving were obtained. Using data obtained from these experiments, dynamics models of both swimming and diving were developed. Through analysis of simulations conducted using these models it was possible to determine several key principles associated with the swimming and diving processes. First, we determined that curved swimming trajectories were more energy efficient than linear trajectories, which explains why they are more often observed in nature. Second, we concluded that the hind legs were able to propel the beetle farther than the middle legs, and also that the hind legs were able to generate a larger angular velocity than the middle legs. However, analysis of circular swimming trajectories showed that the middle legs were important in maintaining stable trajectories, and thus were necessary for steering. Finally, we discovered that in order for the beetle to transition from swimming to diving, the legs must change the plane in which they beat, which provides the force required to alter the tilt angle of the body necessary to break the surface tension of water. We have further examined how the principles learned from this study may be applied to the design of bio-inspired swimming/diving robots.",TRUE
Extracellular electron transfer via microbial nanowires,"Microbes that can transfer electrons to extracellular electron acceptors, such as Fe(iii) oxides, are important in organic matter degradation and nutrient cycling in soils and sediments. Previous investigations on electron transfer to Fe(iii) have focused on the role of outer-membrane c-type cytochromes. However, some Fe(iii) reducers lack c-cytochromes. Geobacter species, which are the predominant Fe(iii) reducers in many environments, must directly contact Fe(iii) oxides to reduce them, and produce monolateral pili that were proposed, on the basis of the role of pili in other organisms, to aid in establishing contact with the Fe(iii) oxides. Here we report that a pilus-deficient mutant of Geobacter sulfurreducens could not reduce Fe(iii) oxides but could attach to them. Conducting-probe atomic force microscopy revealed that the pili were highly conductive. These results indicate that the pili of G. sulfurreducens might serve as biological nanowires, transferring electrons from the cell surface to the surface of Fe(iii) oxides. Electron transfer through pili indicates possibilities for other unique cell-surface and cell‚Äìcell interactions, and for bioengineering of novel conductive materials.",TRUE

Experiments involving synthetic zinc sulfide nanoparticles and representative amino acids indicated a driving role for cysteine in rapid nanoparticle aggregation.

Extreme anoxia tolerance in embryos of the annual killifish Austrofundulus limnaeus: insights from a metabolomics analysis,"The annual killifish Austrofundulus limnaeus survives in ephemeral pond habitats by producing drought-tolerant diapausing embryos. These embryos probably experience oxygen deprivation as part of their normal developmental environment. We assessed the anoxia tolerance of A. limnaeus embryos across the duration of embryonic development. Embryos develop a substantial tolerance to anoxia during early development, which peaks during diapause II. This extreme tolerance of anoxia is retained during the first 4 days of post-diapause II development and is then lost. Metabolism during anoxia appears to be supported mainly by production of lactate, with alanine and succinate production contributing to a lesser degree. Anoxic embryos also accumulate large quantities of Œ≥-aminobutyrate (GABA), a potential protector of neural function. It appears that the suite of characters associated with normal development and entry into diapause II in this species prepares the embryos for long-term survival in anoxia even while the embryos are exposed to aerobic conditions. This is the first report of such extreme anoxia tolerance in a vertebrate embryo, and introduces a new model for the study of anoxia tolerance in vertebrates.",TRUE
Extreme impact and cavitation forces of a biological hammer: strike forces of the peacock mantis shrimp Odontodactylus scyllarus,"SUMMARY Mantis shrimp are renowned for their unusual method of breaking shells with brief, powerful strikes of their raptorial appendages. Due to the extreme speeds of these strikes underwater, cavitation occurs between their appendages and hard-shelled prey. Here we examine the magnitude and relative contribution of the impact and cavitation forces generated by the peacock mantis shrimp Odontodactylus scyllarus. We present the surprising finding that each strike generates two brief, high-amplitude force peaks, typically 390‚Äì480 Œºs apart. Based on high-speed imaging, force measurements and acoustic analyses, it is evident that the first force peak is caused by the limb's impact and the second force peak is due to the collapse of cavitation bubbles. Peak limb impact forces range from 400 to 1501 N and peak cavitation forces reach 504 N. Despite their small size, O. scyllarus can generate impact forces thousands of times their body weight. Furthermore, on average, cavitation peak forces are 50% of the limb's impact force, although cavitation forces may exceed the limb impact forces by up to 280%. The rapid succession of high peak forces used by mantis shrimp suggests that mantis shrimp use a potent combination of cavitation forces and extraordinarily high impact forces to fracture shells. The stomatopod's hammer is fundamentally different from typical shell-crushing mechanisms such as fish jaws and lobster claws, and may have played an important and as yet unexamined role in the evolution of shell form.",TRUE
Extreme resistance of bdelloid rotifers to ionizing radiation,"Rotifers of class Bdelloidea are common invertebrate animals with highly unusual characteristics, including apparently obligate asexuality, the ability to resume reproduction after desiccation at any life stage, and a paucity of transposable genetic elements of types not prone to horizontal transmission. We find that bdelloids are also extraordinarily resistant to ionizing radiation (IR). Reproduction of the bdelloids Adineta vaga and Philodina roseola is much more resistant to IR than that of Euchlanis dilatata, a rotifer belonging to the desiccation-intolerant and facultatively sexual class Monogononta, and all other animals for which we have found relevant data. By analogy with the desiccation- and radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans, we suggest that the extraordinary radiation resistance of bdelloid rotifers is a consequence of their evolutionary adaptation to survive episodes of desiccation encountered in their characteristic habitats and that the damage incurred in such episodes includes DNA breakage that is repaired upon rehydration. Such breakage and repair may have maintained bdelloid chromosomes as colinear pairs and kept the load of transposable genetic elements low and may also have contributed to the success of bdelloid rotifers in avoiding the early extinction suffered by most asexuals.",TRUE
Fast and Facile Biodegradation of Polystyrene by the Gut Microbial Flora of Plesiophthalmus davidis Larvae,"PS is widely produced in the modern world, but it is robust against biodegradation. A few studies reported the biodegradation of PS, but most of them merely observed its weight loss; fewer were able to find its chemical modifications, which are rather direct evidence of biodegradation, by using limited organisms. Therefore, it is required to find an effective way to decompose PS using various kinds of organisms. Herein, we discovered a new PS-degrading insect species and bacterial strain, and we found that the genus that includes the PS-degrading bacterial strain occurs in significant amounts in the larval gut flora, and the proportion of this genus increased as the larvae were fed Styrofoam. Our research offers a wider selection of PS-degrading insects and the possibility of using a certain mixture of bacteria that resemble the gut flora of a PS-degrading insect to biodegrade PS, and thus could contribute to solving the global plastic crisis. ABSTRACT Polystyrene (PS), which accounts for a significant fraction of plastic wastes, is difficult to biodegrade due to its unique molecular structure. Therefore, biodegradation and chemical modification of PS are limited. In this study, we report PS biodegradation by the larvae of the darkling beetle Plesiophthalmus davidis (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). In 14‚Äâdays, P. davidis ingested 34.27‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ4.04‚Äâmg of Styrofoam (PS foam) per larva and survived by feeding only on Styrofoam. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed that the ingested Styrofoam was oxidized. Gel permeation chromatography analysis indicated the decrease in average molecular weight of the residual PS in the frass compared with the feed Styrofoam. When the extracted gut flora was cultured for 20‚Äâdays with PS films, biofilm and cavities were observed by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies revealed that C-O bonding was introduced into the biodegraded PS film. Serratia sp. strain WSW (KCTC 82146), which was isolated from the gut flora, also formed a biofilm and cavities on the PS film in 20‚Äâdays, but its degradation was less prominent than the gut flora. XPS confirmed that C-O and C=O bonds were introduced into the biodegraded PS film by Serratia sp. WSW. Microbial community analysis revealed that Serratia was in the gut flora in significant amounts and increased sixfold when the larvae were fed Styrofoam for 2‚Äâweeks. This suggests that P. davidis larvae and its gut bacteria could be used to chemically modify and rapidly degrade PS. IMPORTANCE PS is widely produced in the modern world, but it is robust against biodegradation.

Fatty Acids Identified in the Burmese Python Promote Beneficial Cardiac Growth,"A specific set of circulating fatty acids triggers cardiac hypertrophy in snakes and mammals. Burmese pythons display a marked increase in heart mass after a large meal. We investigated the molecular mechanisms of this physiological heart growth with the goal of applying this knowledge to the mammalian heart. We found that heart growth in pythons is characterized by myocyte hypertrophy in the absence of cell proliferation and by activation of physiological signal transduction pathways. Despite high levels of circulating lipids, the postprandial python heart does not accumulate triglycerides or fatty acids. Instead, there is robust activation of pathways of fatty acid transport and oxidation combined with increased expression and activity of superoxide dismutase, a cardioprotective enzyme. We also identified a combination of fatty acids in python plasma that promotes physiological heart growth when injected into either pythons or mice.",TRUE
Feeling Small: Exploring the Tactile Perception Limits,"The human finger is exquisitely sensitive in perceiving different materials, but the question remains as to what length scales are capable of being distinguished in active touch. We combine material science with psychophysics to manufacture and haptically explore a series of topographically patterned surfaces of controlled wavelength, but identical chemistry. Strain-induced surface wrinkling and subsequent templating produced 16 surfaces with wrinkle wavelengths ranging from 300‚ÄÖnm to 90‚ÄÖŒºm and amplitudes between 7‚ÄÖnm and 4.5‚ÄÖŒºm. Perceived similarities of these surfaces (and two blanks) were pairwise scaled by participants, and interdistances among all stimuli were determined by individual differences scaling (INDSCAL). The tactile space thus generated and its two perceptual dimensions were directly linked to surface physical properties ‚Äì the finger friction coefficient and the wrinkle wavelength. Finally, the lowest amplitude of the wrinkles so distinguished was approximately 10‚ÄÖnm, demonstrating that human tactile discrimination extends to the nanoscale.",TRUE

Filtration of submicrometer particles by pelagic tunicates,"Salps are common in oceanic waters and have higher per-individual filtration rates than any other zooplankton filter feeder. Although salps are centimeters in length, feeding via particle capture occurs on a fine, mucous mesh (fiber diameter d ‚àº0.1 Œºm) at low velocity (U = 1.6 ¬± 0.6 cm¬∑s‚àí1, mean ¬± SD) and is thus a low Reynolds-number (Re ‚àº10‚àí3) process. In contrast to the current view that particle encounter is dictated by simple sieving of particles larger than the mesh spacing, a low-Re mathematical model of encounter rates by the salp feeding apparatus for realistic oceanic particle-size distributions shows that submicron particles, due to their higher abundances, are encountered at higher rates (particles per time) than larger particles. Data from feeding experiments with 0.5-, 1-, and 3-Œºm diameter polystyrene spheres corroborate these findings. Although particles larger than 1 Œºm (e.g., flagellates, small diatoms) represent a larger carbon pool, smaller particles in the 0.1- to 1-Œºm range (e.g., bacteria, Prochlorococcus) may be more quickly digestible because they present more surface area, and we find that particles smaller than the mesh size (1.4 Œºm) can fully satisfy salp energetic needs. Furthermore, by packaging submicrometer particles into rapidly sinking fecal pellets, pelagic tunicates can substantially change particle-size spectra and increase downward fluxes in the ocean.",TRUE
Finite element modeling of shell shape in the freshwater turtle Pseudemys concinna reveals a trade‚Äêoff between mechanical strength and hydrodynamic efficiency,"Aquatic species can experience different selective pressures on morphology in different flow regimes. Species inhabiting lotic regimes often adapt to these conditions by evolving low‚Äêdrag (i.e., streamlined) morphologies that reduce the likelihood of dislodgment or displacement. However, hydrodynamic factors are not the only selective pressures influencing organismal morphology and shapes well suited to flow conditions may compromise performance in other roles. We investigated the possibility of morphological trade‚Äêoffs in the turtle Pseudemys concinna. Individuals living in lotic environments have flatter, more streamlined shells than those living in lentic environments; however, this flatter shape may also make the shells less capable of resisting predator‚Äêinduced loads. We tested the idea that ‚Äúlotic‚Äù shell shapes are weaker than ‚Äúlentic‚Äù shell shapes, concomitantly examining effects of sex. Geometric morphometric data were used to transform an existing finite element shell model into a series of models corresponding to the shapes of individual turtles. Models were assigned identical material properties and loaded under identical conditions, and the stresses produced by a series of eight loads were extracted to describe the strength of the shells. ‚ÄúLotic‚Äù shell shapes produced significantly higher stresses than ‚Äúlentic‚Äù shell shapes, indicating that the former is weaker than the latter. Females had significantly stronger shell shapes than males, although these differences were less consistent than differences between flow regimes. We conclude that, despite the potential for many‚Äêto‚Äêone mapping of shell shape onto strength, P. concinna experiences a trade‚Äêoff in shell shape between hydrodynamic and mechanical performance. This trade‚Äêoff may be evident in many other turtle species or any other aquatic species that also depend on a shell for defense. However, evolution of body size may provide an avenue of escape from this trade‚Äêoff in some cases, as changes in size can drastically affect mechanical performance while having little effect on hydrodynamic performance.

Fires prime terrestrial organic carbon for riverine export to the global oceans,"Black carbon (BC) is a recalcitrant form of organic carbon (OC) produced by landscape fires. BC is an important component of the global carbon cycle because, compared to unburned biogenic OC, it is selectively conserved in terrestrial and oceanic pools. Here we show that the dissolved BC (DBC) content of dissolved OC (DOC) is twice greater in major (sub)tropical and high-latitude rivers than in major temperate rivers, with further significant differences between biomes. We estimate that rivers export 18‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ4 Tg DBC year ‚àí1 globally and that, including particulate BC fluxes, total riverine export amounts to 43‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ15 Tg BC year ‚àí1 (12‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ5% of the OC flux). While rivers export ~1% of the OC sequestered by terrestrial vegetation, our estimates suggest that 34‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ26% of the BC produced by landscape fires has an oceanic fate. Biogeochemical models require modification to account for the unique dynamics of BC and to predict the response of recalcitrant OC export to changing environmental conditions. Black carbon is a recalcitrant and unique form of organic carbon formed from incomplete combustion. Here the authors use global sampling to reduce uncertainty in the flux of terrestrial black carbon to the oceans, predicting that 34% of black carbon produced by fires has an oceanic fate.",TRUE
"First insights into the chemical defensive system of the erotylid beetle, Tritoma bipustulata","The present study provides the first insights into the chemical defensive system of the erotylid beetle, Tritoma bipustulata, and furthermore reports the previously hardly known ability of abdominal reflex bleeding in this coleopteran family. The defensive chemistry of the secretion of pronotal glands, abdominal reflex blood as well as of the haemolymph were analysed by GC-MS. The different secretions were dominated by aromatic compounds; in addition, we detected alkenes, ketones, organic acids as well as a single sesquiterpene. The majority of these detected compounds had strong antimicrobial properties in microbiological assays with entomopathogenic micro-organisms. In feeding bioassays with ants, only benzyl alcohol, benzothiazole, indole and 3-methylindole, detected in the abdominal reflex blood, were significantly deterrent.",TRUE
Fish Exploiting Vortices Decrease Muscle Activity,"Fishes moving through turbulent flows or in formation are regularly exposed to vortices. Although animals living in fluid environments commonly capture energy from vortices, experimental data on the hydrodynamics and neural control of interactions between fish and vortices are lacking. We used quantitative flow visualization and electromyography to show that trout will adopt a novel mode of locomotion to slalom in between experimentally generated vortices by activating only their anterior axial muscles. Reduced muscle activity during vortex exploitation compared with the activity of fishes engaged in undulatory swimming suggests a decrease in the cost of locomotion and provides a mechanism to understand the patterns of fish distributions in schools and riverine environments.",TRUE
Fish mucous cocoons: the ‚Äòmosquito nets‚Äô of the sea,"Mucus performs numerous protective functions in vertebrates, and in fishes may defend them against harmful organisms, although often the evidence is contradictory. The function of the mucous cocoons that many parrotfishes and wrasses sleep in, while long used as a classical example of antipredator behaviour, remains unresolved. Ectoparasitic gnathiid isopods (Gnathiidae), which feed on the blood of fish, are removed by cleaner fish during the day; however, it is unclear how parrotfish and wrasse avoid gnathiid attacks at night. To test the novel hypothesis that mucous cocoons protect against gnathiids, we exposed the coral reef parrotfish Chlorurus sordidus (Scaridae) with and without cocoons to gnathiids overnight and measured the energetic content of cocoons. Fish without mucous cocoons were attacked more by gnathiids than fish with cocoons. The energetic content of mucous cocoons was estimated as 2.5 per cent of the fish's daily energy budget fish. Therefore, mucous cocoons protected against attacks by gnathiids, acting like mosquito nets in humans, a function of cocoons and an efficient physiological adaptation for preventing parasite infestation that is not used by any other animal.",TRUE
FISH MUCUS: IN SITU MEASUREMENTS OF POLYMER DRAG REDUCTION,The external layer of mucus on fish was investigated as a drag reducing polymer.

The difference in momentum transfer is expressed as a reduction in friction drag and discussed in view of the overall drag experienced by fish.,TRUE
Flagellar oscillation: a commentary on proposed mechanisms,"Eukaryotic flagella and cilia have a remarkably uniform internal ‚Äòengine‚Äô known as the ‚Äò9+2‚Äô axoneme. With few exceptions, the function of cilia and flagella is to beat rhythmically and set up relative motion between themselves and the liquid that surrounds them. The molecular basis of axonemal movement is understood in considerable detail, with the exception of the mechanism that provides its rhythmical or oscillatory quality. Some kind of repetitive ‚Äòswitching‚Äô event is assumed to occur; there are several proposals regarding the nature of the ‚Äòswitch‚Äô and how it might operate. Herein I first summarise all the factors known to influence the rate of the oscillation (the beating frequency). Many of these factors exert their effect through modulating the mean sliding velocity between the nine doublet microtubules of the axoneme, this velocity being the determinant of bend growth rate and bend propagation rate. Then I explain six proposed mechanisms for flagellar oscillation and review the evidence on which they are based. Finally, I attempt to derive an economical synthesis, drawing for preference on experimental research that has been minimally disruptive of the intricate structure of the axoneme. The ‚Äòprovisional synthesis' is that flagellar oscillation emerges from an effect of passive sliding direction on the dynein arms. Sliding in one direction facilitates force‚Äêgenerating cycles and dynein‚Äêto‚Äêdynein synchronisation along a doublet; sliding in the other direction is inhibitory. The direction of the initial passive sliding normally oscillates because it is controlled hydrodynamically through the alternating direction of the propulsive thrust. However, in the absence of such regulation, there can be a perpetual, mechanical self‚Äêtriggering through a reversal of sliding direction due to the recoil of elastic structures that deform as a response to the prior active sliding. This provisional synthesis may be a useful basis for further examination of the problem.",TRUE
Flight activity in pallid swifts Apus pallidus during the non-breeding period,"Flight activity recorders have recently confirmed that alpine and common swifts spend the majority of their non-breeding period on the wing, which may last 6‚Äì10 months. Here we test the hypothesis that the closely related pallid swift, a species with a breeding distribution around the Mediterranean, lead a similar aerial life-style during its migration and wintering periods. The pallid swift usually lays two clutches in one season and therefore spends more time in the breeding area than the common swift. We successfully tracked four pallid swifts with data loggers that record light for geolocation and acceleration every 5 min to monitor flight activity. The birds wintered south of the Sahel in west Africa from the Ivory Coast to Cameroon. The pallid swifts spent the majority of their non-breeding time in flight, especially the first two months after leaving the breeding area in autumn, while a few landing events occurred during the winter. The total time grounded was < 1%, similar to that of the common and alpine swifts. The mass specific flight metabolic rate of swifts is similar to the average non-breeding metabolic rate of a long distance terrestrial migrant, suggesting swifts are not more likely to procure oxidative damage as a consequence of continuous flight than other migrants. The open airspace used by swifts may provide a relatively safe habitat that explain the high survival rate found in swifts.",TRUE
Flow-dependent porosity and other biomechanical properties of mysticete baleen,"SUMMARY Despite its vital function in a highly dynamic environment, baleen is typically assumed to be a static material. Its biomechanical and material properties have not previously been explored. Thus I tested sections of baleen from bowhead whales, Balaena mysticetus, and humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, alone or in groups representing miniature ‚Äòracks‚Äô, in a flow tank through which water and buoyant particles circulated with variable flow velocity. Kinematic sequences were recorded through an endoscopic camera or viewing window. One set of experiments investigated particle capture; another series analyzed biomechanical behavior, including fringe spacing, movement and interaction. Baleen fringe porosity directly correlates, in a mostly linear fashion, with velocity of incident water flow. However, undulation and interaction of fringes (especially of bowheads) at higher flow velocities can decrease porosity. Fringe porosity depends on distance from the baleen plate. Porosity also varies, with fringe length, by position along the length of an individual plate. Plate orientation, which varied from 0 to 90 deg relative to water flow, is crucial in fringe spacing and particle capture. At all flow velocities, porosity is lowest with plates aligned parallel to water flow. Turbulence introduced when plates rotate perpendicular to flow (as in cross-flow filtration) increases fringe interaction, so that particles more easily strike fringes yet more readily dislodge. Baleen of bowhead whales, which feed by continuous ram filtration, differs biomechanically from that of humpbacks, which use intermittent lunge filtration. The longer, finer fringes of bowhead baleen readily form a mesh-like mat, especially at higher flow velocities, to trap tiny particles.",TRUE
FM echolocating bats shift frequencies to avoid broadcast‚Äìecho ambiguity in clutter,"Sonar broadcasts are followed by echoes at different delays from objects at different distances. When broadcasts are emitted rapidly in cluttered surroundings, echo streams from successive broadcasts overlap and cause ambiguity in matching echoes to corresponding broadcasts. To identify reactions to ambiguity in clutter, echolocating bats that emit multiple-harmonic FM sounds were trained to fly into a dense, extended array of obstacles (multiple rows of vertically hanging chains) while the sonar sounds the bat emitted were recorded with a miniature radio microphone carried by the bat. Flight paths were reconstructed from thermal-infrared video recordings. Successive rows of chains extended more than 6 m in depth, so each broadcast was followed by a series of echoes from multiple rows of chains that lasted up to 40 ms. Bats emitted sounds in pairs (‚Äústrobe groups‚Äù) at short (20‚Äì40 ms) interpulse intervals (IPIs) alternating with longer IPIs (>50 ms). For many short IPIs, the stream of echoes from the first broadcast was still arriving when the second broadcast was emitted. This overlap caused ambiguity about matching echoes with broadcasts. Bats shifted frequencies of the first sound in each strobe group upward and the second sound downward by 3‚Äì6 kHz. When overlap and ambiguity ceased, frequency shifts ceased also. Frequency differences were small compared with the total broadcast band, which was 75‚Äì80 kHz wide, but the harmonic structure of echoes enhances the differences in spectrograms. Bats could use time‚Äìfrequency comparisons of echoes with broadcasts to assign echoes to the corresponding broadcasts and thus avoid ambiguity.",TRUE
Foam nest components of the t√∫ngara frog: a cocktail of proteins conferring physical and biological resilience,"The foam nests of the t√∫ngara frog (Engystomops pustulosus) form a biocompatible incubation medium for eggs and sperm while resisting considerable environmental and microbiological assault. We have shown that much of this behaviour can be attributed to a cocktail of six proteins, designated ranaspumins (Rsn-1 to Rsn-6), which predominate in the foam. These fall into two discernable classes based on sequence analysis and biophysical properties. Rsn-2, with an amphiphilic amino acid sequence unlike any hitherto reported, exhibits substantial detergent-like surfactant activity necessary for production of foam, yet is harmless to the membranes of eggs and spermatozoa. A further four (Rsn-3 to Rsn-6) are lectins, three of which are similar to fucolectins found in teleosts but not previously identified in a land vertebrate, though with a carbohydrate binding specificity different from previously described fucolectins. The sixth, Rsn-1, is structurally similar to proteinase inhibitors of the cystatin class, but does not itself appear to exhibit any such activity. The nest foam itself, however, does exhibit potent cystatin activity. Rsn-encoding genes are transcribed in many tissues of the adult frogs, but the full cocktail is present only in oviduct glands. Combinations of lectins and cystatins have known roles in plants and animals for defence against microbial colonization and insect attack. T√∫ngara nest foam displays a novel synergy of selected elements of innate defence plus a specialized surfactant protein, comprising a previously unreported strategy for protection of unattended reproductive stages of animals.",TRUE
"Fog basking by the Namib Desert beetle, Onymacris unguicularis","THE Namib Desert along the south-western coast of Africa supports a sand dune fauna without counterpart elsewhere in the world1. The trophic base of the arthropod fauna is wind-blown detritus2. Aperiodic advective fog collection from vegetation3 or detritus4 is a possible source of water for diverse Namib animals. For the specialised fauna living in vegetation-less dunes, fog collection from detritus4, disturbed sand projections5, directly from humid air6, or from water precipitated on the body4,7, seem to be the only possible water uptake methods. Water uptake from saturated or subsaturated air, demonstrated for a few arthropod species6, is not a physiological capability of Namib tenebrionids already investigated4,6,7.",TRUE
"Fog Catchment Sand Trenches Constructed by Tenebrionid Beetles, Lepidochora, from the Namib Desert",Three species of coastal Namib Desert tenebrionid beetles (Lepidochora) build trenches on desert sand dunes. Trenches are constructed perpendicular to fog winds and concentrate moisture during fogs. The beetles return along the ridges of the trenches extracting water from them. The water content of a population of these beetles increased by 13.9 percent during one fog,TRUE
Foldable structures and the natural design of pollen grains,"Upon release from the anther, pollen grains of angiosperm flowers are exposed to a dry environment and dehydrate. To survive this process, pollen grains possess a variety of physiological and structural adaptations. Perhaps the most striking of these adaptations is the ability of the pollen wall to fold onto itself to prevent further desiccation. Roger P. Wodehouse coined the term harmomegathy for this folding process in recognition of the critical role it plays in the survival of the pollen grain. There is still, however, no quantitative theory that explains how the structure of the pollen wall contributes to harmomegathy. Here we demonstrate that simple geometrical and mechanical principles explain how wall structure guides pollen grains toward distinct folding pathways. We found that the presence of axially elongated apertures of high compliance is critical for achieving a predictable and reversible folding pattern. Moreover, the intricate sculpturing of the wall assists pollen closure by preventing mirror buckling of the surface. These results constitute quantitative structure-function relationships for pollen harmomegathy and provide a framework to elucidate the functional significance of the very diverse pollen morphologies observed in angiosperms.",TRUE
Food dissemination in ants: robustness of the trophallactic network against resource quality,"ABSTRACT Insect societies are often composed of many individuals, achieving collective decisions that depend on environmental and colonial characteristics. For example, ants are able to focus their foraging effort on the most rewarding food source. While this phenomenon is well known, the link between the food source quality and the intranidal food dissemination networks and its dynamics has been neglected. Here, we analysed the global dynamics of food dissemination in Camponotus cruentatus workers, after feeding on a low (0.1‚ÄÖmol‚ÄÖl‚àí1) or on a high (1‚ÄÖmol‚ÄÖl‚àí1) sucrose concentration food source. We also analysed the trophallaxis activity at the individual level and built the complete network of trophallaxis. The results reveal that the dynamics of food dissemination and the structure of the trophallaxis network are robust and independent of the food concentration. We discuss these results in the light of recent advances in the study of efficiency in food management in ants. Summary: Ants show a robust network of food dissemination that is not dependent on the quality of the food.",TRUE
Force production and flow structure of the leading edge vortex on flapping wings at high and low Reynolds numbers,"SUMMARY The elevated aerodynamic performance of insects has been attributed in part to the generation and maintenance of a stable region of vorticity known as the leading edge vortex (LEV). One explanation for the stability of the LEV is that spiraling axial flow within the vortex core drains energy into the tip vortex, forming a leading-edge spiral vortex analogous to the flow structure generated by delta wing aircraft. However, whereas spiral flow is a conspicuous feature of flapping wings at Reynolds numbers (Re) of 5000, similar experiments at Re=100 failed to identify a comparable structure. We used a dynamically scaled robot to investigate both the forces and the flows created by a wing undergoing identical motion at Re of‚àº 120 and ‚àº1400. In both cases, motion at constant angular velocity and fixed angle of attack generated a stable LEV with no evidence of shedding. At Re=1400, flow visualization indicated an intense narrow region of spanwise flow within the core of the LEV, a feature conspicuously absent at Re=120. The results suggest that the transport of vorticity from the leading edge to the wake that permits prolonged vortex attachment takes different forms at different Re.",TRUE
Forisomes: calcium-powered protein complexes with potential as ‚Äòsmart‚Äô biomaterials," Sieve tubes in legumes contain forisomes, which are spindle-like bodies that are composed of ATP-independent, mechanically active proteins. Upon injury, forisomes occlude sieve tubes by dispersion and thus, help to prevent loss of nutrient-rich transport sap. Forisome enlargement by dispersion is brought about by Ca 2+-induced conformational changes that confer radial expansion and longitudinal contraction. Forisomes recontract upon Ca 2+ removal. In vitro, forisomes reversibly disperse and contract in the presence or absence of Ca 2+, respectively, and at distinct pHs. Recently, forisomes have received renewed attention because of their unique capacity to convert chemical into mechanical energy independent of high-energy organic compounds. Forisome-based ‚Äòsmart‚Äô materials can be used to produce self-powered monitoring and diagnostic systems. Here, we focus on physiological, chemical and physical aspects of forisomes and discuss their potential as biomimetic devices.",TRUE
Formation of sphalerite (ZnS) deposits in natural biofilms of sulfate-reducing bacteria.,"Abundant, micrometer-scale, spherical aggregates of 2- to 5-nanometer-diameter sphalerite (ZnS) particles formed within natural biofilms dominated by relatively aerotolerant sulfate-reducing bacteria of the family Desulfobacteriaceae. The biofilm zinc concentration is about 10(6) times that of associated groundwater (0.09 to 1.1 parts per million zinc). Sphalerite also concentrates arsenic (0.01 weight %) and selenium (0.004 weight %). The almost monomineralic product results from buffering of sulfide concentrations at low values by sphalerite precipitation. These results show how microbes control metal concentrations in groundwater- and wetland-based remediation systems and suggest biological routes for formation of some low-temperature ZnS deposits.",TRUE
FOXO-dependent regulation of innate immune homeostasis,"The innate immune system represents an ancient host defence mechanism that protects against invading microorganisms. An important class of immune effector molecules to fight pathogen infections are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that are produced in plants and animals. In Drosophila, the induction of AMPs in response to infection is regulated through the activation of the evolutionarily conserved Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) pathways. Here we show that AMP activation can be achieved independently of these immunoregulatory pathways by the transcription factor FOXO, a key regulator of stress resistance, metabolism and ageing. In non-infected animals, AMP genes are activated in response to nuclear FOXO activity when induced by starvation, using insulin signalling mutants, or by applying small molecule inhibitors. AMP induction is lost in foxo null mutants but enhanced when FOXO is overexpressed. Expression of AMP genes in response to FOXO activity can also be triggered in animals unable to respond to immune challenges due to defects in both the Toll and IMD pathways. Molecular experiments at the Drosomycin promoter indicate that FOXO directly binds to its regulatory region, thereby inducing its transcription. In vivo studies in Drosophila, but also studies in human lung, gut, kidney and skin cells indicate that a FOXO-dependent regulation of AMPs is evolutionarily conserved. Our results indicate a new mechanism of cross-regulation of metabolism and innate immunity by which AMP genes can be activated under normal physiological conditions in response to the oscillating energy status of cells and tissues. This regulation seems to be independent of the pathogen-responsive innate immunity pathways whose activation is often associated with tissue damage and repair. The sparse production of AMPs in epithelial tissues in response to FOXO may help modulating the defence reaction without harming the host tissues, in particular when animals are suffering from energy shortage or stress.",TRUE
Fracture toughness of locust cuticle,"SUMMARY Insect cuticle is one of the most common biological materials, yet very little is known about its mechanical properties. Many parts of the insect exoskeleton, such as the jumping legs of locusts, have to withstand high and repeated loading without failure. This paper presents the first measurements of fracture toughness for insect cuticle using a standard engineering approach. Our results show that the fracture toughness of cuticle in locust hind legs is 4.12 MPa m1/2 and decreases with desiccation of the cuticle. Stiffness and strength of the tibia cuticle were measured using buckling and cantilever bending and increased with desiccation. A combination of the cuticle‚Äôs high toughness with a relatively low stiffness of 3.05 GPa results in a work of fracture of 5.56 kJ m‚Äì2, which is amongst the highest of any biological material, giving the insect leg an exceptional ability to tolerate defects such as cracks and damage. Interestingly, insect cuticle achieves these unique properties without using reinforcement by a mineral phase, which is often found in other biological composite materials. These findings thus might inspire the development of new biomimetic composite materials.",TRUE
Free-standing spider silk webs of the thomisid Saccodomus formivorus are made of composites comprising micro- and submicron fibers,"Our understanding of the extraordinary mechanical and physico-chemical properties of spider silk is largely confined to the fibers produced by orb-weaving spiders, despite the diversity of foraging webs that occur across numerous spider families. Crab spiders (Thomisidae) are described as ambush predators that do not build webs, but nevertheless use silk for draglines, egg cases and assembling leaf-nests. A little-known exception is the Australian thomisid Saccodomus formivorus, which constructs a basket-like silk web of extraordinary dimensional stability and structural integrity that facilitates the capture of its ant prey. We examined the physical and chemical properties of this unusual web and revealed that the web threads comprise microfibers that are embedded within a biopolymeric matrix containing additionally longitudinally-oriented submicron fibers. We showed that the micro- and submicron fibers differ in their chemical composition and that the web threads show a remarkable lateral resilience compared with that of the major ampullate silk of a well-investigated orb weaver. Our novel analyses of these unusual web and silk characteristics highlight how investigations of non-model species can broaden our understanding of silks and the evolution of foraging webs.",TRUE
Frequency specificity of vibration dependent discharge of nematocysts in sea anemones,"Hair bundles on tentacles of sea anemones are similar to vertebrate hair bundles in terms of structure and function. Anemone hair bundles are involved in regulating discharge of nematocysts, ""stinging capsules,"" used to capture prey. N-acetylated sugars from the prey including N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) induce hair bundles to elongate while shifting vibration dependent discharge of nematocysts to lower frequencies matching prey movements. In the present study, we find that vibration dependent discharge of nematocysts exhibits sharp frequency discrimination to within one Hz. Testing at one-Hz intervals over the range of frequencies spanning 1-75 Hz, we find that seven of these are stimulatory in seawater alone. A total of twenty-six frequencies are stimulatory in the presence of NANA. Stimulatory frequencies in NANA are lower than those in seawater alone. We find that antagonists of ryanodine receptors including ryanodine, procaine and tetracaine shift discharge to lower frequencies. Fluorescently tagged ryanodine labels numerous small loci in the apical cytoplasm of supporting cells. We propose that calcium induced calcium release (CICR) via ryanodine receptors may sharpen frequency specificity and/or cause shortening of hair bundles to shift frequency specificity to higher frequencies.",TRUE
Friction enhancement in concertina locomotion of snakes,"Narrow crevices are challenging terrain for most organisms and biomimetic robots. Snakes move through crevices using sequential folding and unfolding of their bodies in the manner of an accordion or concertina. In this combined experimental and theoretical investigation, we elucidate this effective means of moving through channels. We measure the frictional properties of corn snakes, their body kinematics and the transverse forces they apply to channels of varying width and inclination. To climb channels inclined at 60¬∞, we find snakes use a combination of ingenious friction-enhancing techniques, including digging their ventral scales to double their frictional coefficient and pushing channel walls transversely with up to nine times body weight. Theoretical modelling of a one-dimensional n-linked crawler is used to calculate the transverse force factor of safety: we find snakes push up to four times more than required to prevent sliding backwards, presumably trading metabolic energy for an assurance of wall stability.",TRUE
Friend or Foe? Orb-Weaver Spiders Inhabiting Ant‚ÄìAcacias Capture Both Herbivorous Insects and Acacia Ant Alates,"Abstract The orb-weaver spiders Eustala oblonga (Chickering) and Eustala illicita (O. Picard-Cambridge) (Araneae: Araneidae) inhabit the ant-defended acacias Vachellia melanocerus (Beurling) and Vachellia collinsii (Safford) (Fabales: Fabaceae), respectively, in Panama. These spiders do not capture patrolling Pseudomyrmex ants but exploit their plant-protection services to escape predation. What effect the spiders have on the ant-acacia mutualisms is unknown. They may provide an additional layer of plant defense by capturing flying herbivorous insects in their webs. Alternatively, the spiders may disrupt the ant‚Äìacacia mutualisms by capturing alate acacia ants during nuptial flights. We evaluated these two hypotheses by sampling insects flying through acacia foliage and by identifying prey remains in webs. The proportions of insects captured on sticky card traps and in webs varied with taxonomic order and ecological role. Herbivorous insects greatly outnumbered other groups captured on sticky cards and were captured in spiders‚Äô webs in both acacia species but made up a minority of prey remains in webs. Instead, insect predators and parasitoids made up the majority of prey remains and were comprised primarily by alate ant mutualists of the host acacias. These results provide indirect support for both hypotheses and suggest that the spiders potentially both benefit and harm their host ant-acacia mutualisms. The net effect of spider exploitation, however, is unclear and is likely based on both the effectiveness of plant protection from herbivory provided by the spiders relative to that provided by acacia ants, as well as the overall proportion of the ant reproductive caste the spiders actually capture.",TRUE
From three-dimensional weavings to swollen corneocytes,"A novel technique to generate three-dimensional Euclidean weavings, composed of close-packed, periodic arrays of one-dimensional fibres, is described. Some of these weavings are shown to dilate by simple shape changes of the constituent fibres (such as fibre straightening). The free volume within a chiral cubic example of a dilatant weaving, the ideal conformation of the G129 weaving related to the Œ£+ rod packing, expands more than fivefold on filament straightening. This remarkable three-dimensional weaving, therefore, allows an unprecedented variation of packing density without loss of structural rigidity and is an attractive design target for materials. We propose that the G129 weaving (ideal Œ£+ weaving) is formed by keratin fibres in the outermost layer of mammalian skin, probably templated by a folded membrane.",TRUE
FT Protein Movement Contributes to Long-Distance Signaling in Floral Induction of Arabidopsis,"In plants, seasonal changes in day length are perceived in leaves, which initiate long-distance signaling that induces flowering at the shoot apex. The identity of the long-distance signal has yet to be determined. In Arabidopsis, activation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) transcription in leaf vascular tissue (phloem) induces flowering. We found that FT messenger RNA is required only transiently in the leaf. In addition, FT fusion proteins expressed specifically in phloem cells move to the apex and move long distances between grafted plants. Finally, we provide evidence that FT does not activate an intermediate messenger in leaves. We conclude that FT protein acts as a long-distance signal that induces Arabidopsis flowering.",TRUE
Fuel-Powered Artificial Muscles,"Artificial muscles and electric motors found in autonomous robots and prosthetic limbs are typically battery-powered, which severely restricts the duration of their performance and can necessitate long inactivity during battery recharge. To help solve these problems, we demonstrated two types of artificial muscles that convert the chemical energy of high‚Äìenergy-density fuels to mechanical energy. The first type stores electrical charge and uses changes in stored charge for mechanical actuation. In contrast with electrically powered electrochemical muscles, only half of the actuator cycle is electrochemical. The second type of fuel-powered muscle provides a demonstrated actuator stroke and power density comparable to those of natural skeletal muscle and generated stresses that are over a hundred times higher.",TRUE
Function of blue iridescence in tropical understorey plants,"The blue colouration seen in the leaves of Selaginella willdenowii is shown to be iridescent. Transmission electron microscopy studies confirm the presence of a layered lamellar structure of the upper cuticle of iridescent leaves. Modelling of these multi-layer structures suggests that they are responsible for the blue iridescence, confirming the link between the observed lamellae and the recorded optical properties. Comparison of blue and green leaves from the same plant indicates that the loss of the blue iridescence corresponds to a loss of the multi-layer structure. The results reported here do not support the idea that iridescence in plants acts to enhance light capture of photosynthetically important wavelengths. The reflectance of light in the range 600‚Äì700 nm is very similar for both iridescent and non-iridescent leaves. However, owing to the occurrence of blue colouration in a wide variety of shade dwelling plants it is probable that this iridescence has some adaptive benefit. Possible adaptive advantages of the blue iridescence in these plants are discussed.",TRUE
Function of spiral grain in trees,"SummaryThrough spiral grain, conduits for sap lead from each root to all branches. This uniform distribution of sap is indicated by the paths of vessels and tracheids, and has been proven experimentally by means of dyed sap injected into the base of stems or taken up by roots. Trees receiving water only from roots at one side of the root collar nevertheless stay green and continue growing. Spiral grain in bark distributes food from each branch to other flanks of the stem and to most roots. Experimental interruptions of the sap and food conduits caused the cambial zone to reorient new conduit cells in new directions, bypassing the interruption. In particular, spiral grooves cut into the stem surface caused spiral grain. The new cells reorient through division and growth. Although spiral grain is largely under genetic control, trees appear to have a spiral grain especially where needed for distribution of water when root spheres are dry at one side. Compared with straight-grained trees, spiral-grained stems and branches bend and twist more when exposed to strong wind, in this way offering less wind resistance and being less likely to break. Through the bending and twisting, snow slides down from branches rather than breaking them, but the main function of spiral grain is the uniform distribution of supplies from each root to all branches, and from each branch to many roots.",TRUE
"Functional anatomy of the valves in the ambulacral system of sea urchins (Echinodermata, Echinoida)","SummaryThe water vascular system of sea urchins is examined with special reference to the valves positioned between the radial vessel and the ampullae of the tube feet. The lips of the valve protrude into the ampulla. Thus the valve functions mainly like a check valve that allows the unidirectional flow of fluid towards the ampulla. Each ampulla-tube foot compartment acts as a semi-autonomous hydraulic system. The lumina of the ampulla and the tube foot are lined with myoepithelia except for the interconnecting channels that pierce the ambulacral plate. The contraction of the ampulla results in an increasing hydraulic pressure that protrudes the tube foot, provided that the valve is closed. The retraction of the tube foot results in a backflow of fluid independent of the condition of the valve. The lips of the valve are folds of the hydrocoel epithelium. The pore slit lies in the midline. The perradial faces of the lips are covered with the squamous epithelium of the lateral water vessel. The ampullar faces are specialized parts of the ampulla myoepithelium. Turgescent cells which form incompressible cushions take the place of the support cells. The valve myocytes run parallel to the pore slit and form processes that run along the base of the ampulla and the perradial channel up to the podial retractor muscle. The findings lead to the hypothesis of multiple control of the ampulla-tube foot system: (1) The mutual activity of the ampulla and the tube foot is indirectly controlled by the lateral and podial nerves which release transmitter substances that diffuse through the connective tissue up to the muscle layers. (2) A muscle-to-muscle conduction causes the simultaneous contraction of the ampulla or the podial retractor muscles. (3) The valve muscles are directly controlled by the processes of the valve myocytes which make contact with the podial retractor. In extreme conditions a backflow of hydrocoel fluid towards the radial water vessel occurs.",TRUE
Functional Dorsoventral Symmetry in Relation to Lift-Based Swimming in the Ocean Sunfish Mola mola,"The largest (up to 2 tons) and a globally distributed teleost‚Äîthe ocean sunfish Mola mola‚Äîis commonly regarded as a planktonic fish because of its unusual shape including absence of caudal fin. This common view was recently questioned because the horizontal movements of the ocean sunfish tracked by acoustic telemetry were independent of ocean currents. However, direct information regarding their locomotor performance under natural conditions is still lacking. By using multi-sensor tags, we show that sunfish indeed swam continuously with frequent vertical movements at speeds of 0.4‚Äì0.7 m s‚Äì1, which is similar to the records of other large fishes such as salmons, marlins, and pelagic sharks. The acceleration data revealed that they stroked their dorsal and anal fins synchronously (dominant frequency, 0.3‚Äì0.6 Hz) to generate a lift-based thrust, as penguins do using two symmetrical flippers. Morphological studies of sunfish (mass, 2‚Äì959 kg) showed that the dorsal and anal fins had similar external (symmetrical shape and identical area) and internal (identical locomotory muscle mass) features; however, the muscle shape differed markedly. We conclude that ocean sunfish have functional dorsoventral symmetry with regards to the non-homologous dorsal and anal fins that act as a pair of vertical hydrofoils. Although sunfish lack a swimbladder, we found that they are neutrally buoyant independent of depth because of their subcutaneous gelatinous tissue that has low density and is incompressible. Efficient lift-based swimming in conjunction with neutral buoyancy enables sunfish to travel long distances both horizontally and vertically.",TRUE
Functional morphology and movements of the proboscis of Lepidoptera (Insecta),"SummaryThe mouthparts of Lepidoptera were investigated in a number of species by morphological and cinematographical methods. Both the galeae (which compose the proboscis) and the basal maxillary components (stipites) were studied in the resting position, in motion, and during feeding. In the resting position the proboscis is coiled so tightly that the surfaces of the consecutive coils are in close contact and the outermost coil touches the ventral side of the head. Cuticular processes of the galeal wall interlock between the coils in this position. In the investigated species they occur on the galeal wall and on the ventral side of the head in varying number and distribution. By the extension of the basal galeal joint, the coiled proboscis is released from its resting position and is elevated continuously. It uncoils in 3‚Äì5 steps which effect the entire length simultaneously. Each uncoiling step occurs synchronously with a compression of the stipital tubes on either side of the body. These compression movements pump hemolymph into the galeae. In all investigated Lepidoptera the uncoiled proboscis shows a distinct downward bend at a certain point which is also detectable in anaesthetized or freshly killed animals in some species. This feeding position and the movements of the uncoiled proboscis are similar in all species despite the intrinsic galeal muscles being variously arranged in the galeal lumen in different Lepidoptera. When comparing cross-sections through corresponding regions of coiled and uncoiled proboscises, the curvatures of the dorsal galeal walls remain unchanged. Coiling of the proboscis starts at the tip and progresses to the base. After coiling the proboscis tightly beneath the head, the diameter of the spiral widens due to its elastic properties until the proboscis props itself against the ventral side of the head. This elastic effect combined with the interlocking cuticular processes seems to be responsible for the resting position of the proboscis.",TRUE
Functional morphology of scale hinges used to transport water: convergent drinking adaptations in desert lizards (Moloch horridus and Phrynosoma cornutum),"The Australian thorny devil, Moloch horridus Gray, 1841, and the Texas horned lizard, Phrynosoma cornutum Harlan, 1825, have the remarkable ability to rapidly move water through interscalar spaces on their skin‚Äôs surface to their mouth for drinking. The morphology of these scale hinges has not been studied. We used histological and SEM techniques to examine and compare the scale hinges of both species. Additional taxa in their respective lineages were examined in order to evaluate the potential that convergent evolution has occurred. In the two species that transport water, each scale hinge has a basally expanded and semi-enclosed channel formed by the hinge joint that is interconnected with all scale hinges on the body. We hypothesize that it is within this semi-tubular channel system of hinge joints, where the Œ≤-layer keratin of the integument is very thin, that water is transported. Hinge joint walls are covered by a complex topography of fractured surfaces that greatly expand the channel‚Äôs surface area and probably enhance capillary transport of water. In addition, we note differing morphology of scale surfaces at the rear of the jaws of both species. We hypothesize that capillary forces fill the scale-hinge system and additional forces, generated within the mouth by observed motions during drinking, depress local water-pressure to pull water through the channels of the hinge-joint system. We conclude that the combined features in the two species, semi-tubular hinge-joint channels with convoluted walls and a jaw-buccal cavity pumping-mechanism, have convergently evolved for capture, transport, and drinking of water from sporadic rainfall.",TRUE
Fungal invasion of massive corals,". Five species of corals from the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal (Indian Ocean) have been regularly found to have single or multiple necrotic patches. The occurrence of such corals with necrotic patches varied from 10‚Äì50% in the field. Sections revealed a septate dark brown mycelial fungus on the surface and subsurface of the dead patches in five coral species. The fungus was isolated in culture and identified as Scolecobasidium sp.    The fungus formed a distinct dense brown to black zone of 0.5-1.5 cm width immediately below the surface of the corals. In terms of biomass, the fungus was estimated to contribute 3‚Äì5 mg cm -3 of coral skeleton.",TRUE
Gait selection in the ostrich: mechanical and metabolic characteristics of walking and running with and without an aerial phase,"It has been argued that minimization of metabolic‚Äìenergy costs is a primary determinant of gait selection in terrestrial animals. This view is based predominantly on data from humans and horses, which have been shown to choose the most economical gait (walking, running, galloping) for any given speed. It is not certain whether a minimization of metabolic costs is associated with the selection of other prevalent forms of terrestrial gaits, such as grounded running (a widespread gait in birds). Using biomechanical and metabolic measurements of four ostriches moving on a treadmill over a range of speeds from 0.8 to 6.7 m s‚àí1, we reveal here that the selection of walking or grounded running at intermediate speeds also favours a reduction in the metabolic cost of locomotion. This gait transition is characterized by a shift in locomotor kinetics from an inverted‚Äìpendulum gait to a bouncing gait that lacks an aerial phase. By contrast, when the ostrich adopts an aerial‚Äìrunning gait at faster speeds, there are no abrupt transitions in mechanical parameters or in the metabolic cost of locomotion. These data suggest a continuum between grounded and aerial running, indicating that they belong to the same locomotor paradigm.",TRUE
Ganglion-specific splicing of TRPV1 underlies infrared sensation in vampire bats,"Vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) are obligate blood feeders that have evolved specialized systems to suit their sanguinary lifestyle. Chief among such adaptations is the ability to detect infrared radiation as a means of locating hotspots on warm-blooded prey. Among vertebrates, only vampire bats, boas, pythons and pit vipers are capable of detecting infrared radiation. In each case, infrared signals are detected by trigeminal nerve fibres that innervate specialized pit organs on the animal‚Äôs face. Thus, vampire bats and snakes have taken thermosensation to the extreme by developing specialized systems for detecting infrared radiation. As such, these creatures provide a window into the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying evolutionary tuning of thermoreceptors in a species-specific or cell-type-specific manner. Previously, we have shown that snakes co-opt a non-heat-sensitive channel, vertebrate TRPA1 (transient receptor potential cation channel A1), to produce an infrared detector. Here we show that vampire bats tune a channel that is already heat-sensitive, TRPV1, by lowering its thermal activation threshold to about 30‚Äâ¬∞C. This is achieved through alternative splicing of TRPV1 transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. These splicing events occur exclusively in trigeminal ganglia, and not in dorsal root ganglia, thereby maintaining a role for TRPV1 as a detector of noxious heat in somatic afferents. This reflects a unique organization of the bat Trpv1 gene that we show to be characteristic of Laurasiatheria mammals (cows, dogs and moles), supporting a close phylogenetic relationship with bats. These findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism for physiological tuning of thermosensory nerve fibres.",TRUE
Genetic Control of Surface Curvature,"Although curvature of biological surfaces has been considered from mathematical and biophysical perspectives, its molecular and developmental basis is unclear. We have studied the cinmutant of Antirrhinum, which has crinkly rather than flat leaves. Leaves of cin display excess growth in marginal regions, resulting in a gradual introduction of negative curvature during development. This reflects a change in the shape and the progression of a cell-cycle arrest front moving from the leaf tip toward the base. CIN encodes a TCP protein and is expressed downstream of the arrest front. We propose that CIN promotes zero curvature (flatness) by making cells more sensitive to an arrest signal, particularly in marginal regions.",TRUE
Geographical Variation in Bill Size across Bird Species Provides Evidence for Allen‚Äôs Rule,"Allen‚Äôs rule proposes that the appendages of endotherms are smaller, relative to body size, in colder climates, in order to reduce heat loss. Empirical support for Allen‚Äôs rule is mainly derived from occasional reports of geographical clines in extremity size of individual species. Interspecific evidence is restricted to two studies of leg proportions in seabirds and shorebirds. We used phylogenetic comparative analyses of 214 bird species to examine whether bird bills, significant sites of heat exchange, conform to Allen‚Äôs rule. The species comprised eight diverse taxonomic groups‚Äîtoucans, African barbets, Australian parrots, estrildid finches, Canadian galliforms, penguins, gulls, and terns. Across all species, there were strongly significant relationships between bill length and both latitude and environmental temperature, with species in colder climates having significantly shorter bills. Patterns supporting Allen‚Äôs rule in relation to latitudinal or altitudinal distribution held within all groups except the finches. Evidence for a direct association with temperature was found within four groups (parrots, galliforms, penguins, and gulls). Support for Allen‚Äôs rule in leg elements was weaker, suggesting that bird bills may be more susceptible to thermoregulatory constraints generally. Our results provide the strongest comparative support yet published for Allen‚Äôs rule and demonstrate that thermoregulation has been an important factor in shaping the evolution of bird bills.",TRUE
Geometry and self-righting of turtles,"Terrestrial animals with rigid shells face imminent danger when turned upside down. A rich variety of righting strategies of beetle and turtle species have been described, but the exact role of the shell's geometry in righting is so far unknown. These strategies are often based on active mechanisms, e.g. most beetles self-right via motion of their legs or wings; flat, aquatic turtles use their muscular neck to flip back. On the other hand, highly domed, terrestrial turtles with short limbs and necks have virtually no active control: here shape itself may serve as a fundamental tool. Based on field data gathered on a broad spectrum of aquatic and terrestrial turtle species we develop a geometric model of the shell. Inspired by recent mathematical results, we demonstrate that a simple mechanical classification of the model is closely linked to the animals' righting strategy. Specifically, we show that the exact geometry of highly domed terrestrial species is close to optimal for self-righting, and the shell's shape is the predominant factor of their ability to flip back. Our study illustrates how evolution solved a far-from-trivial geometrical problem and equipped some turtles with monostatic shells: beautiful forms, which rarely appear in nature otherwise.",TRUE
Giant siliceous spicules from the deep-sea glass sponge Monorhaphis chuni,"Only 13 years after realizing, during a repair of a telegraph cable pulled out from the deep sea, that the depth of the ocean is plentifully populated with a highly diverse fauna and flora, the Challenger expedition (1873-1876) treasured up a rich collection of vitreous sponges (Hexactinellida). They had been described by Schulze and represent the phylogenetically oldest class of siliceous sponges (phylum Porifera); they are eye-catching because of their distinct body plan, which relies on a filigree skeleton. It is constructed by an array of morphologically determined elements, the spicules. Soon after, during the German Deep Sea Expedition ""Valdivia"" (1898-1899), Schulze could describe the largest siliceous hexactinellid sponge on Earth, the up to 3-m high Monorhaphis chuni, which develops the equally largest bio-silica structure, the giant basal spicules (3 mx10 mm). Using these spicules as a model, basic knowledge on the morphology, formation, and development of the skeletal elements could be achieved. They are formed by a proteinaceous scaffold (composed of a 27-kDa protein), which mediates the formation of the siliceous lamellae, into which the proteins are encased. The high number of 800 of 5-10 microm thick lamellae is concentrically arranged around the axial canal. The silica matrix is composed of almost pure silicon oxide, providing it with unusually optophysical properties, which are superior to those of man-made waveguides. Experiments might suggest that the spicules function in vivo as a nonocular photoreception system. In addition, the spicules have exceptional mechanical properties, combining mechanical stability with strength and stiffness. Like demosponges, also the hexactinellids synthesize their silica enzymatically, via the enzyme silicatein (27-kDa protein). It is suggested that these basic insights will surely contribute to a further applied utilization and exploration of silica in bio-material/biomedical science.",TRUE
"Grass roots chemistry: meta-Tyrosine, an herbicidal nonprotein amino acid","Fine fescue grasses displace neighboring plants by depositing large quantities of an aqueous phytotoxic root exudate in the soil rhizosphere. Via activity-guided fractionation, we have isolated and identified the nonprotein amino acid m-tyrosine as the major active component. m-Tyrosine is significantly more phytotoxic than its structural isomers o- and p-tyrosine. We show that m-tyrosine exposure results in growth inhibition for a wide range of plant species and propose that the release of this nonprotein amino acid interferes with root development of competing plants. Acid hydrolysis of total root protein from Arabidopsis thaliana showed incorporation of m-tyrosine, suggesting this as a possible mechanism of phytotoxicity. m-Tyrosine inhibition of A. thaliana root growth is counteracted by exogenous addition of protein amino acids, with phenylalanine having the most significant effect. The discovery of m-tyrosine, as well as a further understanding of its mode(s) of action, could lead to the development of biorational approaches to weed control.",TRUE
Great hammerhead sharks swim on their side to reduce transport costs,"Animals exhibit various physiological and behavioural strategies for minimizing travel costs. Fins of aquatic animals play key roles in efficient travel and, for sharks, the functions of dorsal and pectoral fins are considered well divided: the former assists propulsion and generates lateral hydrodynamic forces during turns and the latter generates vertical forces that offset sharks' negative buoyancy. Here we show that great hammerhead sharks drastically reconfigure the function of these structures, using an exaggerated dorsal fin to generate lift by swimming rolled on their side. Tagged wild sharks spend up to 90% of time swimming at roll angles between 50¬∞ and 75¬∞, and hydrodynamic modelling shows that doing so reduces drag‚Äîand in turn, the cost of transport‚Äîby around 10% compared with traditional upright swimming. Employment of such a strongly selected feature for such a unique purpose raises interesting questions about evolutionary pathways to hydrodynamic adaptations, and our perception of form and function.",TRUE
Group structure and kinship in beluga whale societies,"Evolutionary explanations for mammalian sociality typically center on inclusive-fitness benefits of associating and cooperating with close kin, or close maternal kin as in some whale societies, including killer and sperm whales. Their matrilineal structure has strongly influenced the thinking about social structure in less well-studied cetaceans, including beluga whales. In a cross-sectional study of group structure and kinship we found that belugas formed a limited number of distinct group types, consistently observed across populations and habitats. Certain behaviours were associated with group type, but group membership was often dynamic. MtDNA-microsatellite profiling combined with relatedness and network analysis revealed, contrary to predictions, that most social groupings were not predominantly organized around close maternal relatives. They comprised both kin and non-kin, many group members were paternal rather than maternal relatives, and unrelated adult males often traveled together. The evolutionary mechanisms that shape beluga societies are likely complex; fitness benefits may be achieved through reciprocity, mutualism and kin selection. At the largest scales these societies are communities comprising all ages and both sexes where multiple social learning pathways involving kin and non-kin can foster the emergence of cultures. We explore the implications of these findings for species management and the evolution of menopause.",TRUE
"Growth, geometry, and mechanics of a blooming lily","Despite the common use of the blooming metaphor, its floral inspiration remains poorly understood. Here we study the physical process of blooming in the asiatic lily Lilium casablanca. Our observations show that the edges of the petals wrinkle as the flower opens, suggesting that differential growth drives the deployment of these laminar shell-like structures. We use a combination of surgical manipulations and quantitative measurements to confirm this hypothesis and provide a simple theory for this change in the shape of a doubly curved thin elastic shell subject to differential growth across its planform. Our experiments and theory overturn previous hypotheses that suggest that blooming is driven by differential growth of the inner layer of the petals and in the midrib by providing a qualitatively different paradigm that highlights the role of edge growth. This functional morphology suggests new biomimetic designs for deployable structures using boundary or edge actuation rather than the usual bulk or surface actuation.",TRUE
Gyroscopic stabilization minimizes drag on Ruellia ciliatiflora seeds,"Fruits of Ruellia ciliatiflora (Acanthaceae) explosively launch small (2.5 mm diameter √ó 0.46 mm thick), disc-shaped seeds at velocities over 15 m s‚àí1, reaching distances of up to 7 m. Through high-speed video analysis, we observe that seeds fly with extraordinary backspin of up to 1660 Hz. By modelling the seeds as spinning discs, we show that flying with backspin is stable against gyroscopic precession. This stable backspin orientation minimizes the frontal area during flight, decreasing drag force on the seeds and thus increasing dispersal distance. From high-speed video of the seeds' flight, we experimentally determine drag forces that are 40% less than those calculated for a sphere of the same volume and density. This reduces the energy costs for seed dispersal by up to a factor of five.",TRUE
Hagfish predatory behaviour and slime defence mechanism,"Hagfishes (Myxinidae), a family of jawless marine pre-vertebrates, hold a unique evolutionary position, sharing a joint ancestor with the entire vertebrate lineage. They are thought to fulfil primarily the ecological niche of scavengers in the deep ocean. However, we present new footage from baited video cameras that captured images of hagfishes actively preying on other fish. Video images also revealed that hagfishes are able to choke their would-be predators with gill-clogging slime. This is the first time that predatory behaviour has been witnessed in this family, and also demonstrates the instantaneous effectiveness of hagfish slime to deter fish predators. These observations suggest that the functional adaptations and ecological role of hagfishes, past and present, might be far more diverse than previously assumed. We propose that the enduring success of this oldest extant family of fishes over 300 million years could largely be due to their unique combination of functional traits.",TRUE
Harbor seal vibrissa morphology suppresses vortex-induced vibrations,"SUMMARY Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) often live in dark and turbid waters, where their mystacial vibrissae, or whiskers, play an important role in orientation. Besides detecting and discriminating objects by direct touch, harbor seals use their whiskers to analyze water movements, for example those generated by prey fish or by conspecifics. Even the weak water movements left behind by objects that have passed by earlier can be sensed and followed accurately (hydrodynamic trail following). While scanning the water for these hydrodynamic signals at a swimming speed in the order of meters per second, the seal keeps its long and flexible whiskers in an abducted position, largely perpendicular to the swimming direction. Remarkably, the whiskers of harbor seals possess a specialized undulated surface structure, the function of which was, up to now, unknown. Here, we show that this structure effectively changes the vortex street behind the whiskers and reduces the vibrations that would otherwise be induced by the shedding of vortices from the whiskers (vortex-induced vibrations). Using force measurements, flow measurements and numerical simulations, we find that the dynamic forces on harbor seal whiskers are, by at least an order of magnitude, lower than those on sea lion (Zalophus californianus) whiskers, which do not share the undulated structure. The results are discussed in the light of pinniped sensory biology and potential biomimetic applications.",TRUE
Hardness in arthropod exoskeletons in the absence of transition metals.,"The arthropod cuticle is a remarkable and versatile biological material commonly composed of chitin and proteins. Lessons can be learned from the way it is adapted to fit its functions. The larval jewel beetle, Pseudotaenia frenchi, demonstrates hardness in the cutting edge of the mandibles in excess of the mineralized carapace of stone crabs and compares favourably with some stainless steels. Yet this is a form of cuticle which is devoid of transition metals or mineralization. In seeming contradiction, the similarly dark coloured adult beetle mandibles contain the transition metal manganese, but are significantly softer. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis and infrared spectroscopy have been used to investigate the differences in composition of mandible cuticle of the adult and larval beetles.",TRUE
"Harmless nectar source or deadly trap: Nepenthes pitchers are activated by rain, condensation and nectar","The leaves of Nepenthes pitcher plants are specialized pitfall traps which capture and digest arthropod prey. In many species, insects become trapped by ‚Äòaquaplaning‚Äô on the wet pitcher rim (peristome). Here we investigate the ecological implications of this capture mechanism in Nepenthes rafflesiana var. typica. We combine meteorological data and continuous field measurements of peristome wetness using electrical conductance with experimental assessments of the pitchers' capture efficiency. Our results demonstrate that pitchers can be highly effective traps with capture rates as high as 80% but completely ineffective at other times. These dramatic changes are due to the wetting condition of the peristome. Variation of peristome wetness and capture efficiency was perfectly synchronous, and caused by rain, condensation and nectar secreted from peristome nectaries. The presence of nectar on the peristome increased surface wetness mainly indirectly by its hygroscopic properties. Experiments confirmed that pitchers with removed peristome nectaries remained generally drier and captured prey less efficiently than untreated controls. This role of nectar in prey capture represents a novel function of plant nectar. We propose that the intermittent and unpredictable activation of Nepenthes pitcher traps facilitates ant recruitment and constitutes a strategy to maximize prey capture.",TRUE
"Harnessing disorder: onychophorans use highly unstructured proteins, not silks, for prey capture","Onychophora are ancient, carnivorous soft-bodied invertebrates which capture their prey in slime that originates from dedicated glands located on either side of the head. While the biochemical composition of the slime is known, its unusual nature and the mechanism of ensnaring thread formation have remained elusive. We have examined gene expression in the slime gland from an Australian onychophoran, Euperipatoides rowelli, and matched expressed sequence tags to separated proteins from the slime. The analysis revealed three categories of protein present: unique high-molecular-weight proline-rich proteins, and smaller concentrations of lectins and small peptides, the latter two likely to act as protease inhibitors and antimicrobial agents. The predominant proline-rich proteins (200 kDa+) are composed of tandem repeated motifs and distinguished by an unusually high proline and charged residue content. Unlike the highly structured proteins such as silks used for prey capture by spiders and insects, these proteins lack ordered secondary structure over their entire length. We propose that on expulsion of slime from the gland onto prey, evaporative water loss triggers a glass transition change in the protein solution, resulting in adhesive and enmeshing thread formation, assisted by cross-linking of complementary charged and hydrophobic regions of the protein. Euperipatoides rowelli has developed an entirely new method of capturing prey by harnessing disordered proteins rather than structured, silk-like proteins.",TRUE
Heat Exchange from the Toucan Bill Reveals a Controllable Vascular Thermal Radiator,"Toucan Heat Exchanger Toucans are instantly recognizable by their large bills, which in the toco toucan (Ramphastos toco) accounts for about one-third of the total body length. The toucan's bill has been interpreted as a sexual ornament and as an adaptation for handling fruit. Tattersall et al. (p. 468) explore an alternative explanation in which the bill serves primarily as a thermoregulator. Infrared thermography techniques, which allow detailed observations with minimal disturbance to the birds, show that the birds alter blood flow to the bill according to ambient conditions, effectively using it as a radiator to ‚Äúdump heat.‚Äù Toucans alter blood flow to their massive bills according to ambient conditions. The toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), the largest member of the toucan family, possesses the largest beak relative to body size of all birds. This exaggerated feature has received various interpretations, from serving as a sexual ornament to being a refined adaptation for feeding. However, it is also a significant surface area for heat exchange. Here we show the remarkable capacity of the toco toucan to regulate heat distribution by modifying blood flow, using the bill as a transient thermal radiator. Our results indicate that the toucan's bill is, relative to its size, one of the largest thermal windows in the animal kingdom, rivaling elephants‚Äô ears in its ability to radiate body heat.",TRUE
Heat exchange in relation to blood flow between thorax and abdomen in bumblebees,"1. The narrow passage within the petiole between thorax and abdomen is anatomically constructed so that counter-current exchange should retain heat in the thorax despite blood flow to and from the cool abdomen. 2. However, the counter-current heat exchanger can be physiologically circumvented. Exogenously heated bumblebees prevented overheating of the thorax by shunting heat into the abdomen. They also regurgitated fluid, which helped to reduce head temperature but had little effect on thoracic temperature. 3. Temperature increases in the ventrum of the abdomen occurred in steps exactly coinciding with the beats of the ventral diaphragm, and with the abdominal 'ventilatory' pumping movements when these were present. The ability to prevent overheating of the thorax by transport of heat to the abdomen was abolished when the heart was made inoprative. 4. At low thoracic temperatures the ventral diaphragm beat at a wide range or rates and with varying interbeat intervals, while the heart beat at a high frequency relative to the ventral diaphragm, but at a very low amplitude. However, when thoracic temperature exceeded 43 degrees C the amplitudes of both were high, and the interbeat intervals as well as the beating frequencies of the two pulsatile organs became identical in any one bee. Furthermore, heated bees engaged in vigorous abdominal pumping at the same frequency as that of their heart and ventral diaphragm pulsations. 5. The results indicate that the anatomical counter-current heat exchanger is reduced or eliminated during heat stress by 'chopping' the blood flow into pulses, and the blood pulses are shunted through the petiole alternately by way of a switch mechanism.",TRUE

Hedgehog signaling is necessary and sufficient to mediate craniofacial plasticity in teleosts,"Significance Phenotypic plasticity has emerged as an important concept in evolutionary biology. It is thought to contribute to an organism‚Äôs ability to adapt to environmental change within a single generation, which may facilitate survival and increase fitness. Furthermore, plasticity has the potential to bias the direction and/or speed of evolution by changing patterns of phenotypic variation and exposing new genetic variation to selection (i.e., flexible stem evolution). Our understanding of this important phenomenon is incomplete owing to limited knowledge of the molecular underpinnings of reaction norm evolution. Using the teleost feeding apparatus as a model, we explore this open question and show that the Hh signaling pathway underlies the ability of this structure to respond plastically to alternate feeding regimes. Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a single genotype to produce multiple phenotypes under different environmental conditions, is critical for the origins and maintenance of biodiversity; however, the genetic mechanisms underlying plasticity as well as how variation in those mechanisms can drive evolutionary change remain poorly understood. Here, we examine the cichlid feeding apparatus, an icon of both prodigious evolutionary divergence and adaptive phenotypic plasticity. We first provide a tissue-level mechanism for plasticity in craniofacial shape by measuring rates of bone deposition within functionally salient elements of the feeding apparatus in fishes forced to employ alternate foraging modes. We show that levels and patterns of phenotypic plasticity are distinct among closely related cichlid species, underscoring the evolutionary potential of this trait. Next, we demonstrate that hedgehog (Hh) signaling, which has been implicated in the evolutionary divergence of cichlid feeding architecture, is associated with environmentally induced rates of bone deposition. Finally, to demonstrate that Hh levels are the cause of the plastic response and not simply the consequence of producing more bone, we use transgenic zebrafish in which Hh levels could be experimentally manipulated under different foraging conditions. Notably, we find that the ability to modulate bone deposition rates in different environments is dampened when Hh levels are reduced, whereas the sensitivity of bone deposition to different mechanical demands increases with elevated Hh levels. These data advance a mechanistic understanding of phenotypic plasticity in the teleost feeding apparatus and in doing so contribute key insights into the origins of adaptive morphological radiations.",TRUE
Helminths and the IBD hygiene hypothesis,"&NA; Helminths are parasitic animals that have evolved over 100,000,000 years to live in the intestinal track or other locations of their hosts. Colonization of humans with these organisms was nearly universal until the early 20th century. More than 1,000,000,000 people in less developed countries carry helminths even today. Helminths must quell their host's immune system to successfully colonize. It is likely that helminths sense hostile changes in the local host environment and take action to control such responses. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) probably results from an inappropriately vigorous immune response to contents of the intestinal lumen. Environmental factors strongly affect the risk for IBD. People living in less developed countries are protected from IBD. The ‚ÄúIBD hygiene hypothesis‚Äù states that raising children in extremely hygienic environments negatively affects immune development, which predisposes them to immunological diseases like IBD later in life. Modern day absence of exposure to intestinal helminths appears to be an important environmental factor contributing to development of these illnesses. Helminths interact with both host innate and adoptive immunity to stimulate immune regulatory circuitry and to dampen effector pathways that drive aberrant inflammation. The first prototype worm therapies directed against immunological diseases are now under study in the United States and various countries around the world. Additional studies are in the advanced planning stage.",TRUE
Hepatitis C virus exploits cyclophilin A to evade PKR,"Counteracting innate immunity is essential for successful viral replication. Host cyclophilins (Cyps) have been implicated in viral evasion of host antiviral responses, although the mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we show that hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-opts the host protein CypA to aid evasion of antiviral responses dependent on the effector protein kinase R (PKR). Pharmacological inhibition of CypA rescues PKR from antagonism by HCV NS5A, leading to activation of an interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1)-driven cell intrinsic antiviral program that inhibits viral replication. These findings further the understanding of the complexity of Cyp-virus interactions, provide mechanistic insight into the remarkably broad antiviral spectrum of Cyp inhibitors, and uncover novel aspects of PKR activity and regulation. Collectively, our study identifies a novel antiviral mechanism that harnesses cellular antiviral immunity to suppress viral replication.",TRUE
Herbivory meets fungivory: insect herbivores feed on plant pathogenic fungi for their own benefit.,"Plants are regularly colonised by fungi and bacteria, but plant-inhabiting microbes are rarely considered in studies on plant-herbivore interactions. Here we show that young gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) caterpillars prefer to feed on black poplar (Populus nigra) foliage infected by the rust fungus Melampsora larici-populina instead of uninfected control foliage, and selectively consume fungal spores. This consumption, also observed in a related lepidopteran species, is stimulated by the sugar alcohol mannitol, found in much higher concentration in fungal tissue and infected leaves than uninfected plant foliage. Gypsy moth larvae developed more rapidly on rust-infected leaves, which cannot be attributed to mannitol but rather to greater levels of total nitrogen, essential amino acids and B vitamins in fungal tissue and fungus-infected leaves. Herbivore consumption of fungi and other microbes may be much more widespread than commonly believed with important consequences for the ecology and evolution of plant-herbivore interactions.",TRUE
Hierarchical architecture of spider attachment setae reconstructed from scanning nanofocus X-ray diffraction data,"When sitting and walking, the feet of wandering spiders reversibly attach to many surfaces without the use of gluey secretions. Responsible for the spiders' dry adhesion are the hairy attachment pads that are built of specially shaped cuticular hairs (setae) equipped with approximately 1 ¬µm wide and 20 nm thick plate-like contact elements (spatulae) facing the substrate. Using synchrotron-based scanning nanofocus X-ray diffraction methods, combining wide-angle X-ray diffraction/scattering and small-angle X-ray scattering, allowed substantial quantitative information to be gained about the structure and materials of these fibrous adhesive structures with 200 nm resolution. The fibre diffraction patterns showed the crystalline chitin chains oriented along the long axis of the attachment setae and increased intensity of the chitin signal dorsally within the seta shaft. The small-angle scattering signals clearly indicated an angular shift by approximately 80¬∞ of the microtrich structures that branch off the bulk hair shaft and end as the adhesive contact elements in the tip region of the seta. The results reveal the specific structural arrangement and distribution of the chitin fibres within the attachment hair's cuticle preventing material failure by tensile reinforcement and proper distribution of stresses that arise upon attachment and detachment.",TRUE
Hierarchical assembly of the siliceous skeletal lattice of the hexactinellid sponge Euplectella aspergillum.,"Despite its inherent mechanical fragility, silica is widely used as a skeletal material in a great diversity of organisms ranging from diatoms and radiolaria to sponges and higher plants. In addition to their micro- and nanoscale structural regularity, many of these hard tissues form complex hierarchically ordered composites. One such example is found in the siliceous skeletal system of the Western Pacific hexactinellid sponge, Euplectella aspergillum. In this species, the skeleton comprises an elaborate cylindrical lattice-like structure with at least six hierarchical levels spanning the length scale from nanometers to centimeters. The basic building blocks are laminated skeletal elements (spicules) that consist of a central proteinaceous axial filament surrounded by alternating concentric domains of consolidated silica nanoparticles and organic interlayers. Two intersecting grids of non-planar cruciform spicules define a locally quadrate, globally cylindrical skeletal lattice that provides the framework onto which other skeletal constituents are deposited. The grids are supported by bundles of spicules that form vertical, horizontal and diagonally ordered struts. The overall cylindrical lattice is capped at its upper end by a terminal sieve plate and rooted into the sea floor at its base by a flexible cluster of barbed fibrillar anchor spicules. External diagonally oriented spiral ridges that extend perpendicular to the surface further strengthen the lattice. A secondarily deposited laminated silica matrix that cements the structure together additionally reinforces the resulting skeletal mass. The mechanical consequences of each of these various levels of structural complexity are discussed.",TRUE
Hierarchical organisation of the trap in the protocarnivorous plant Roridula gorgonias (Roridulaceae),"SUMMARY The flypaper trap of the protocarnivorous plant Roridula gorgonias is known to capture various insects, even those having a considerable body size, by using an adhesive, visco-elastic resinous secretion released by glandular trichomes of different dimensions. However, recent experimental studies have shown that the adhesion of long tentacle-shaped trichome secretion is not as strong as previously assumed. One may then ask why this flypaper trap is so highly effective. In the present study, we compared geometry, flexibility and the adhesive properties of secretion in different sized trichomes. We have analysed the gross morphology of the plant and its surfaces using light and cryo-scanning electron microscopy. Trichomes' stiffness and the adhesive properties of their secretion on different surfaces were measured. A combination of structural and experimental results, presented in this study, let us suggest that R. gorgonias represents a three-dimensional trap consisting of three functional hierarchical levels (plant, leaves and trichomes). According to their size, we classified three types of trichomes having a particular arrangement on the leaf. The longest trichomes are more flexible and less adhesive compared with the shortest ones. The latter are 48 times stiffer and their secretion has a 9 times higher adhesive strength. Our data support the hypothesis that the shortest trichomes are adapted to strong, long-term adherence to prey insects, and that the longest trichomes are responsible for initial trapping and entanglement function.",TRUE
High Abrasion Resistance with Sparse Mineralization: Copper Biomineral in Worm Jaws,"Biominerals are widely exploited to harden or stiffen tissues in living organisms, with calcium-, silicon-, and iron-based minerals being most common. In notable contrast, the jaws of the marine bloodworm Glycera dibranchiata contain the copper-based biomineral atacamite [Cu2(OH)3Cl]. Polycrystalline fibers are oriented with the outer contour of the jaw. Using nanoindentation, we show that the mineral has a structural role and enhances hardness and stiffness. Despite the low degree of mineralization, bloodworm jaws exhibit an extraordinary resistance to abrasion, significantly exceeding that of vertebrate dentin and approaching that of tooth enamel.",TRUE
High aerodynamic lift from the tail reduces drag in gliding raptors,"ABSTRACT Many functions have been postulated for the aerodynamic role of the avian tail during steady-state flight. By analogy with conventional aircraft, the tail might provide passive pitch stability if it produced very low or negative lift. Alternatively, aeronautical principles might suggest strategies that allow the tail to reduce inviscid, induced drag: if the wings and tail act in different horizontal planes, they might benefit from biplane-like aerodynamics; if they act in the same plane, lift from the tail might compensate for lift lost over the fuselage (body), reducing induced drag with a more even downwash profile. However, textbook aeronautical principles should be applied with caution because birds have highly capable sensing and active control, presumably reducing the demand for passive aerodynamic stability, and, because of their small size and low flight speeds, operate at Reynolds numbers two orders of magnitude below those of light aircraft. Here, by tracking up to 20,000, 0.3‚ÄÖmm neutrally buoyant soap bubbles behind a gliding barn owl, tawny owl and goshawk, we found that downwash velocity due to the body/tail consistently exceeds that due to the wings. The downwash measured behind the centreline is quantitatively consistent with an alternative hypothesis: that of constant lift production per planform area, a requirement for minimizing viscous, profile drag. Gliding raptors use lift distributions that compromise both inviscid induced drag minimization and static pitch stability, instead adopting a strategy that reduces the viscous drag, which is of proportionately greater importance to lower Reynolds number fliers. Summary: Aerodynamic lift from gliding hawk and owl tails, revealed by tracking helium bubbles, is inconsistent with passive stability or minimizing induced drag, but indicates a role in reducing viscous drag.",TRUE
High-speed microscopic imaging of flagella motility and swimming in Giardia lamblia trophozoites,"We report, in this paper, several findings about the swimming and attachment mechanisms of Giardia lamblia trophozoites. These data were collected using a combination of a high-contrast CytoViva imaging system and a particle image velocimetry camera, which can capture images at speeds greater than 800 frames/s. Using this system, we discovered that, during rapid swimming of Giardia trophozoites, undulations of the caudal region contributed to forward propulsion combined with the beating of the flagella pairs. It was also discovered, in contrast to previous studies with 10 times slower image sampling technique, that the anterior and posterolateral flagella beat with a clearly defined power stroke and not symmetrical undulations. During the transition from free swimming to attachment, trophozoites modified their swimming behavior from a rapid rotating motion to a more stable planar swimming. While using this planar swimming motion, the trophozoites used the flagella for propulsion and directional control. In addition to examination of the posterolateral and anterior flagella, a model to describe the motion of the ventral flagella was derived, indicating that the ventral flagella beat in an expanding sine wave. In addition, the structure of the ventrocaudal groove creates boundary conditions that determine the form of beating of the ventral flagella. The results from this study indicate that Giardia is able to simultaneously generate both ciliary beating and typical eukaryotic flagellar beating using different pairs of flagella.",TRUE
"Home Ranges, Movement, and Den Use in Long-Beaked Echidnas, Zaglossus Bartoni, from Papua New Guinea","Abstract Long-beaked echidnas (Zaglossus), which are endemic to New Guinea, are the largest and least-studied of the 3 extant genera of monotremes. Zaglossus is listed as endangered by the World Conservation Union and data regarding the natural history of long-beaked echidnas are critical to efforts to protect these animals. However, no detailed studies of the ecology of this genus have been published. From 2000 to 2005, I captured 22 Zaglossus bartoni in the Crater Mountain Wildlife Management Area in Simbu Province, Papua New Guinea. Mean body masses for these animals were 6.5 kg ¬± 1.4 SD (n = 15, range: 4.2‚Äì9.1 kg) for adults and 4.3 ¬± 7.4 kg (n = 6, range: 3.2‚Äì5.1 kg) for juveniles. Eleven of the adults captured were followed via radiotelemetry for 1‚Äì12 months. The home ranges for these individuals varied in size from 10 to 168 ha. Home-range size was not correlated with body mass, age, or sex. Long-beaked echidna dens were most commonly located in underground burrows, although individual echidnas favored different types of den sites. Mean burrow length was 2.7 m ¬± 1.8 SD (n = 5, range: 1.3‚Äì4.9 m) and mean den depth was 0.48 m ¬± 7.8 SD (n = 5, range: 0.42‚Äì0.57 m) below the soil surface. Animals were never found foraging in daylight. Although no animals were found with eggs or young in the pouch, 1 individual was lactating when captured in April 2002 and again in April 2005. The data generated by this study provide valuable insights into echidna biology that will facilitate efforts to conserve populations of these unusual mammals.",TRUE
Honey Bee Nest Thermoregulation: Diversity Promotes Stability,"A honey bee colony is characterized by high genetic diversity among its workers, generated by high levels of multiple mating by its queen. Few clear benefits of this genetic diversity are known. Here we show that brood nest temperatures in genetically diverse colonies (i.e., those sired by several males) tend to be more stable than in genetically uniform ones (i.e., those sired by one male). One reason this increased stability arises is because genetically determined diversity in workers' temperature response thresholds modulates the hive-ventilating behavior of individual workers, preventing excessive colony-level responses to temperature fluctuations.",TRUE
Honeybee combs: construction through a liquid equilibrium process?,"Geometrical investigations of honeycombs and speculations on how honeybees measure and construct the hexagons and rhombi of their cells are centuries old. Here we show that honeybees neither have to measure nor construct the highly regular structures of a honeycomb, and that the observed pattern of combs can be parsimoniously explained by wax flowing in liquid equilibrium. The structure of the combs of honeybees results from wax as a thermoplastic building medium, which softens and hardens as a result of increasing and decreasing temperatures. It flows among an array of transient, close-packed cylinders which are actually the self-heated honeybees themselves. The three apparent rhomboids forming the base of each cell do not exist but arise as optical artefacts from looking through semi-transparent combs.",TRUE
Honeybee flight: a novel ‚Äòstreamlining‚Äô response,"SUMMARY Animals that move rapidly through the air can save considerable energy by reducing the drag that they need to overcome during flight. We describe a novel ‚Äòstreamlining‚Äô response in tethered, flying honeybees in which the abdomen is held in a raised position when the visual system is exposed to a pattern of image motion that is characteristic of forward flight. This visually evoked response, which can be elicited without exposing the insect to any airflow, presumably serves to reduce the aerodynamic drag that would otherwise be produced by the abdomen during real flight. The response is critically dependent on the presence of appropriate image motion everywhere within the large field of view of the insect.

Allopolyploidization events within the Xenopodinae have given rise to tetraploid, octoploid, and dodecaploid species. The primary structures and distributions of host-defense peptides from the tetraploid frogs Xenopus borealis, Xenopus clivii, Xenopus laevis, Xenopus muelleri, ""X. muelleri West"", and Xenopus petersii may be compared with those from the octoploid frogs Xenopus amieti and X. andrei. Similarly, components in skin secretions from the diploid frog Silurana tropicalis may be compared with those from the tetraploid frog Silurana paratropicalis. All Xenopus antimicrobial peptides may be classified in the magainin, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (PGLa), caerulein-precursor fragment (CPF), and xenopsin-precursor fragment (XPF) families. However, the numbers of paralogs from the octoploid frogs were not significantly greater than the corresponding numbers from the tetraploid frogs. Magainins were not identified in skin secretions of Silurana frogs and the multiplicity of the PGLa, CPF, and XPF peptides from S. paratropicalis was not greater than that of S. tropicalis. The data indicate, therefore, that nonfunctionalization (gene silencing) has been the most common fate of antimicrobial peptide genes following polyploidization. While some duplicated gene products retain high antimicrobial potency (subfunctionalization), the very low activity of others suggests that they may be evolving towards a new biological role (neofunctionalization). CPF-AM1 and PGLa-AM1 from X. amieti show potential for development into anti-infective agents for use against antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria.",TRUE
Hot bees in empty broodnest cells: heating from within,"SUMMARY Honeybee colonies maintain brood nest temperatures of 33‚Äì36¬∞C. We investigated brood nest thermoregulation at the level of individual worker behaviour and the transfer of heat from workers to the brood. Worker bees contribute to the regulation of brood nest temperature by producing heat while sitting motionless on the caps of brood cells. We report here an additional, newly observed heating strategy where heating bees enter empty cells between sealed brood cells and remain there motionless for periods of up to 45 min. Individually marked worker bees on the surface of sealed brood cells maintained thorax temperatures (Tth) between 32.2¬±1.0¬∞C and 38.1¬±2.5¬∞C (mean ¬± s.d.; N=20 bees) with alternating warming and cooling periods. Most of the observed bees made one or several long-duration visits (>2 min) to empty cells within the sealed brood area. Tth at the time bees entered a cell [Tth(entry)] was 34.1‚Äì42.5¬∞C (N=40). In 83% of these cell visits, Tth(entry) was higher (up to 5.9¬∞C; mean 2.5¬±1.5¬∞C; N=33) than the mean Tth of the same bee. High values of Tth(entry) resulted from preceding heating activity on the comb surface and from warm-ups just prior to cell visits during which Tth increased by up to +9.6¬∞C. Bees inside empty cells had mean Tth values of 32.7¬±0.1¬∞C (resting bees) to 40.6¬±0.7¬∞C (heat-producing bees) during long-duration cell visits without performing any visible work. Heating behaviour inside cells resembles heating behaviour on the brood cap surface in that the bees appear to be inactive, but repeated warmings and coolings occur and Tth does not fall below the optimum brood temperature. Bees staying still inside empty cells for several minutes have previously been considered to be `resting bees'. We find, however, that the heating bees can be distinguished from the resting bees not only by their higher body temperatures but also by the continuous, rapid respiratory movements of their abdomens. By contrast, abdominal pumping movements in resting bees are discontinuous and interrupted by long pauses. Heat transfer to the brood from individual bees on the comb surface and from bees inside empty cells was simulated under controlled conditions. Heating on the comb surface causes a strong superficial warming of the brood cap by up to 3¬∞C within 30 min. Heat transfer is 1.9‚Äì2.6 times more efficient when the thorax is in touch with the brood cap than when it is not. Heating inside empty cells raises the brood temperature of adjacent cells by up to 2.5¬∞C within 30 min. Heat flow through the comb was detectable up to three brood cells away from the heated thorax.",TRUE
How ants use quorum sensing to estimate the average quality of a fluctuating resource,"We show that one of the advantages of quorum-based decision-making is an ability to estimate the average value of a resource that fluctuates in quality. By using a quorum threshold, namely the number of ants within a new nest site, to determine their choice, the ants are in effect voting with their feet. Our results show that such quorum sensing is compatible with homogenization theory such that the average value of a new nest site is determined by ants accumulating within it when the nest site is of high quality and leaving when it is poor. Hence, the ants can estimate a surprisingly accurate running average quality of a complex resource through the use of extraordinarily simple procedures.",TRUE
How aphids lose their marbles,"Insects provide examples of many cunning stratagems to cope with the challenges of living in a world dominated by surface forces. Despite being the current masters of the land environment, they are at constant risk of being entrapped in liquids, which they prevent by having waxy and hairy surfaces. The problem is particularly acute in an enclosed space, such as a plant gall. Using secreted wax to efficiently parcel and transport their own excrement, aphids were able to solve this problem 200 Myr ago. Here, we report on the physical and physiological significance of this ingenious solution. The secreted powdery wax has three distinct roles: (i) it is hydrophobic, (ii) it creates a microscopically rough inner gall surface made of weakly compacted wax needles making the gall ultra‚Äìhydrophobic, and (iii) it coats the honeydew droplets converting them into liquid marbles, that can be rapidly and efficiently moved.",TRUE
How Archer Fish Achieve a Powerful Impact: Hydrodynamic Instability of a Pulsed Jet in Toxotes jaculatrix,"Archer fish knock down insects anchored to vegetation by hitting them with a precisely aimed jet of water. The striking force of the jet at the impact is such to overcome the strong anchoring forces of insects. The origin of the effectiveness of such hunting mechanism has been long searched for inside of the fish, in the unsuccessful attempt to identify internal structures dedicated to the amplification of muscular power. Here we perform a kinematic analysis of the jet emitted by two specimens of Toxotes jaculatrix. We estimate that at the impact the jet conveys a typical specific power of about 3000 W/kg, which is well above the maximum specific power of the order of 500 W/kg deliverable by a vertebrate muscle. Unexpectedly, we find that the amplification of muscular power occurs outside of the fish, and is due to a hydrodynamic instability of the jet akin to those occurring in Drop-on-Demand inkjet printing. The investigated fish are found to modulate the velocity of the jet at the orifice to favor the formation of a single, large, water drop that hits the prey abruptly with a large momentum. The observed mechanism represents a remarkable example of use of an external hydrodynamic lever that does possibly not entail the high evolutionary cost needed for the development of highly specialized internal structures dedicated to the storing of mechanical energy.",TRUE
How Cats Lap: Water Uptake by Felis catus,"Lap Cats We all know that domestic cats lap milk, but perhaps fewer of us have thought about how they do this. Reis et al. (p. 1231, published online 11 November; see the cover) have discovered that cats curl their tongues so that the top surface touches the water. Then, by lifting their tongues rapidly, a column of liquid grows by inertia until gravity induces its breakage and the cats close their jaws to capture the liquid. Lapping frequency is tuned to maximize the volume ingested, depending on the animal's mass; a relationship that holds as true for tabby cats as it does for lions. Cats use fluid inertia to generate a liquid column that they catch in their mouths before gravity destroys it. Animals have developed a range of drinking strategies depending on physiological and environmental constraints. Vertebrates with incomplete cheeks use their tongue to drink; the most common example is the lapping of cats and dogs. We show that the domestic cat (Felis catus) laps by a subtle mechanism based on water adhesion to the dorsal side of the tongue. A combined experimental and theoretical analysis reveals that Felis catus exploits fluid inertia to defeat gravity and pull liquid into the mouth. This competition between inertia and gravity sets the lapping frequency and yields a prediction for the dependence of frequency on animal mass. Measurements of lapping frequency across the family Felidae support this prediction, which suggests that the lapping mechanism is conserved among felines.",TRUE
How do ants stick out their tongues?,"The mouthparts are very important tools for almost any task performed by ants. In particular, the labiomaxillary complex is essential for food intake. In the present study we investigated the anatomical design of the labiomaxillary complex in various ant species, focusing on movement mechanisms. Six labial and six maxillary muscles with different functions control the several joints and ensure the proper performance of the labiomaxillary complex. According to our measurements of sarcomere lengths, muscle fiber lengths and diameters, and the relative muscle volumes, the labial and maxillary muscles feature rather slow than fast muscle characteristics and do not seem to be specialized for specific tasks. Since glossa protractor muscles are absent, the protraction of the glossa, the distal end of the labium, is a nonmuscular movement. By histological measurements of hemolymph volumes we could exclude a pressure‚Äêdriven mechanism. Additional experiments showed that, upon relaxation of the glossa retractor muscles, the glossa protracts elastically. This elastic mechanism possibly sets an upper limit to licking frequency, thus influencing food intake rates and ultimately foraging behavior. In contrast to many other elastic mechanisms among arthropods, glossa protraction in ants is based on a mechanism where elasticity works as an actual antagonist to muscles. We compared the design of the labiomaxillary complex of ants with that of the honeybee and suggest an elastic mechanism for glossa protraction in honeybees as well. J.

How Do Benthic Organisms Withstand Moving Water,"Many aquatic plants and animals spend part of their lives anchored to the substratum as water flows by. There are a number of mechanisms by which such sessile organisms can affect the magnitude of the flow-induced forces they encounter, as well as the distribution and magnitude of the mechanical stresses in their bodies produced by those forces. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the skeletal tissues of such organisms affect how much they deform and whether or not they will break in response to flow-induced stresses. There are different mechanisms by which organisms can withstand the water flow characterizing a particular type of habitat. Biomechanics is a useful tool for studying how the performance of organisms depends on their structure. Biomechanical studies should be accompanied by knowledge of the natural history and ecology of the organisms in question if they are to lead to insights about how organisms work.",TRUE
How do hoverflies use their righting reflex?,"ABSTRACT When taking off from a sloping surface, flies have to reorient themselves dorsoventrally and stabilize their body by actively controlling their flapping wings. We have observed that righting is achieved solely by performing a rolling manoeuvre. How flies manage to do this has not yet been elucidated. It was observed here for the first time that hoverfly reorientation is entirely achieved within 6 wingbeats (48.8‚ÄÖms) at angular roll velocities of up to 10√ó103 deg s‚àí1 and that the onset of their head rotation consistently follows that of their body rotation after a time lag of 16‚ÄÖms. The insects' body roll was found to be triggered by the asymmetric wing stroke amplitude, as expected. The righting process starts immediately with the first wingbeat and seems unlikely to depend on visual feedback. A dynamic model for the fly's righting reflex is presented, which accounts for the head/body movements and the time lag recorded in these experiments. This model consists of a closed-loop control of the body roll, combined with a feedforward control of the head/body angle. During the righting manoeuvre, a strong coupling seems to exist between the activation of the halteres (which measure the body's angular speed) and the gaze stabilization reflex. These findings again confirm the fundamental role played by the halteres in both body and head stabilization processes. Summary: Hoverfly righting is achieved by performing a rolling manoeuvre; reorientation is achieved within 6 wingbeats and hoverfly head rotation follows that of their body after a time lag of 16‚ÄÖms.",TRUE
How do plants ‚Äúnotice‚Äù attack by herbivorous arthropods?,"Precise and deep comprehension of plant responses to herbivorous arthropods requires detailed knowledge of how a plant ‚Äúnotices‚Äù the attack.

Touch, secretions released with eggs and regurgitate delivered during feeding may act in concert as elicitors of plant defence. Here, we discuss the current knowledge of what a plant ‚Äúnotices‚Äù during the different phases of herbivore attack and how it responds at the molecular, physiological and ecological level. Understanding the mechanisms of plant responses to the different phases of herbivore attack will be a key challenge in unravelling the complex communication pathways between plants and herbivores.",TRUE
"How do sucker-footed bats hold on, and why do they roost head-up?","Individuals of most bat species hang head-down by their toenails from rough surfaces, but Madagascar‚Äôs endemic sucker-footed bat (Myzopoda aurita) clings head-up to smooth leaves using specialized pads on its wrists and ankles. We investigated the adhesive performance of 28 individuals and found that attachment performance on brass was not affected by the presence or absence of a seal around the pad‚Äìsurface interface. Furthermore, on smooth acrylic, the wrist pads were more than nine-fold weaker when lifted perpendicular to the surface than when pulled parallel to it. The unimportance of a seal and the difference in strength in those directions on a smooth surface are characteristic of wet adhesion, but not of suction. Thus, despite its name, the sucker-footed bat appears to adhere using wet adhesion. We observed that when wrist pads were pushed anteriorly, they unpeeled easily from the surface because of deformation of the pads. This most likely permits rapid detachment during crawling, but would also cause passive detachment if bats roosted head-down. This provides an ecomorphological explanation to the head-up roosting behaviour of these unique bats. The results obtained in the present study thus link morphology, behaviour, and roosting ecology for an enigmatic Malagasy endemic. ¬© 2009 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2010, 99, 233‚Äì240.

"How does a slender tibia resist buckling? Effect of material, structural and geometric characteristics on buckling behaviour of the hindleg tibia in stick insect postembryonic development","ABSTRACT During the lifespan of the stick insect Carausius morosus, their long and narrow tibiae experience substantial compressive loads. The mechanical load on the tibiae increases as the weight of the insect rises. The increase in body weight is accompanied by a notable increase in the insect's body size and, accordingly, by an increase in the length of the tibiae. Both of these changes can raise the risk of buckling of the tibiae. In this study, we tracked changes in the material and geometric properties of the hindleg tibia of C. morosus during growth. The results show that although buckling (either by Euler buckling or local buckling) is the dominant failure mode under compression, the tibia is very capable of maintaining its buckling resistance in each postembryonic developmental stage. This is essentially the result of a compromise between the increasing slenderness of the tibia and its increasing material stiffness. The use of an optimal radius to thickness ratio, a soft resilin-dominated core, and chitin fibres oriented in both longitudinal and circumferential directions are presumably additional strategies preventing buckling of the tibia. This study, providing the first quantitative data on changes in the biomechanical properties of cuticle during the entire life of an insect, is expected to shed more light on the structure‚Äìproperty‚Äìfunction relationship in this complex biological composite. Summary: Quantitative data on changes in biomechanical properties of hindleg tibia cuticle during the entire life of the stick insect Carausius morosus indicate strategies preventing buckling of the tibia.",TRUE
How kelp produce blade shapes suited to different flow regimes: A new wrinkle.,"Many species of macroalgae have flat, strap-like blades in habitats exposed to rapidly flowing water, but have wide, ruffled ""undulate"" blades at protected sites. We used the giant bull kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana, to investigate how these ecomorphological differences are produced. The undulate blades of N. luetkeana from sites with low flow remain spread out and flutter erratically in moving water, thereby not only enhancing interception of light, but also increasing drag. In contrast, strap-like blades of kelp from habitats with rapid flow collapse into streamlined bundles and flutter at low amplitude in flowing water, thus reducing both drag and interception of light. Transplant experiments in the field revealed that shape of the blade in N. luetkeana is a plastic trait. Laboratory experiments in which growing blades from different sites were subjected to tensile forces that mimicked the hydrodynamic drag experienced by blades in different flow regimes showed that change in shape is induced by mechanical stress. During growth experiments in the field and laboratory, we mapped the spatial distribution of growth in both undulate and strap-like blades to determine how these different morphologies were produced. The highest growth rates occur near the proximal ends of N. luetkeana blades of both morphologies, but the rates of transverse growth of narrow, strap-like blades are lower than those of wide, undulate blades. If rates of longitudinal growth at the edges of a blade exceed the rate of longitudinal growth along the midline of the blade, ruffles along the edges of the blade are produced by elastic buckling. In contrast, flat blades are produced when rates of longitudinal growth are similar across the width of a blade. Because ruffles are the result of elastic buckling, a compliant undulate N. luetkeana blade can easily be pushed into different configurations (e.g., the wavelengths of the ruffles along the edges of the blade can change, and the whole blade can twist into left- and right-handed helicoidal shapes), which may enhance movements of the blade in flowing water that reduce self-shading and increase mass exchange along blade surfaces.",TRUE
How pine cones open,"The scales of seed-bearing pine cones move in response to changes in relative humidity. The scales gape open when it is dry, releasing the cone's seeds. When it is damp, the scales close up. The cells in a mature cone are dead, so the mechanism is passive: the structure of the scale and the walls of the cells composing the scale respond to changing relative humidity. Dissection of cones from the Monterey pine, Pinus radiata, revealed to us two types of scale growing from the main body of the cone ‚Äî the ovuliferous scale and the bract scale. The larger ovuliferous scales respond to changes in relative humidity when removed from the body of the cone.",TRUE
How snapping shrimp snap: through cavitating bubbles.,"The snapping shrimp (Alpheus heterochaelis) produces a loud snapping sound by an extremely rapid closure of its snapper claw. One of the effects of the snapping is to stun or kill prey animals. During the rapid snapper claw closure, a high-velocity water jet is emitted from the claw with a speed exceeding cavitation conditions. Hydrophone measurements in conjunction with time-controlled high-speed imaging of the claw closure demonstrate that the sound is emitted at the cavitation bubble collapse and not on claw closure. A model for the bubble dynamics based on a Rayleigh-Plesset-type equation quantitatively accounts for the time dependence of the bubble radius and for the emitted sound.",TRUE
How super is supercontraction? Persistent versus cyclic responses to humidity in spider dragline silk,"SUMMARY Spider dragline silk has enormous potential for the development of biomimetic fibers that combine strength and elasticity in low density polymers. These applications necessitate understanding how silk reacts to different environmental conditions. For instance, spider dragline silk `supercontracts' in high humidity. During supercontraction, unrestrained dragline silk contracts up to 50% of its original length and restrained fibers generate substantial stress. Here we characterize the response of dragline silk to changes in humidity before, during and after supercontraction. Our findings demonstrate that dragline silk exhibits two qualitatively different responses to humidity. First, silk undergoes a previously unknown cyclic relaxation‚Äìcontraction response to wetting and drying. The direction and magnitude of this cyclic response is identical both before and after supercontraction. By contrast, supercontraction is a `permanent' tensioning of restrained silk in response to high humidity. Here, water induces stress, rather than relaxation and the uptake of water molecules results in a permanent change in molecular composition of the silk, as demonstrated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Even after drying, silk mass increased by‚àº 1% after supercontraction. By contrast, the cyclic response to humidity involves a reversible uptake of water. Dried, post-supercontraction silk also differs mechanically from virgin silk. Post-supercontraction silk exhibits reduced stiffness and stress at yield, as well as changes in dynamic energy storage and dissipation. In addition to advancing understanding supercontraction, our findings open up new applications for synthetic silk analogs. For example, dragline silk emerges as a model for a biomimetic muscle, the contraction of which is precisely controlled by humidity alone.",TRUE
How swifts control their glide performance with morphing wings,"Gliding birds continually change the shape and size of their wings, presumably to exploit the profound effect of wing morphology on aerodynamic performance. That birds should adjust wing sweep to suit glide speed has been predicted qualitatively by analytical glide models, which extrapolated the wing‚Äôs performance envelope from aerodynamic theory. Here we describe the aerodynamic and structural performance of actual swift wings, as measured in a wind tunnel, and on this basis build a semi-empirical glide model. By measuring inside and outside swifts‚Äô behavioural envelope, we show that choosing the most suitable sweep can halve sink speed or triple turning rate. Extended wings are superior for slow glides and turns; swept wings are superior for fast glides and turns. This superiority is due to better aerodynamic performance‚Äîwith the exception of fast turns. Swept wings are less effective at generating lift while turning at high speeds, but can bear the extreme loads. Finally, our glide model predicts that cost-effective gliding occurs at speeds of 8‚Äì10‚Äâm‚Äâs-1, whereas agility-related figures of merit peak at 15‚Äì25‚Äâm‚Äâs-1. In fact, swifts spend the night (‚Äòroost‚Äô) in flight at 8‚Äì10‚Äâm‚Äâs-1 (ref. 11), thus our model can explain this choice for a resting behaviour. Morphing not only adjusts birds‚Äô wing performance to the task at hand, but could also control the flight of future aircraft.",TRUE
How the Cucumber Tendril Coils and Overwinds,"Curls Beget More Curls Cucumber tendrils reach up to find an attachment, and then coil to shorten and drag the plant up toward the sunlight. Gerbode et al. (p. 1087) analyzed the biomechanics of cucumber tendril coiling. The process depends on a thin layer of cells within the tendril that becomes lignified during the coiling process. A construct of pre-strained silicon sheets, fabric ribbon, and copper wire reproduced the coiling functions in abiotic materials. Physical and mathematical models explained the peculiar response by which the cucumber tendril initially overwinds when pulled further. Plants climb via lifelines that are a mix of strength and flexibility. The helical coiling of plant tendrils has fascinated scientists for centuries, yet the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Moreover, despite Darwin‚Äôs widely accepted interpretation of coiled tendrils as soft springs, their mechanical behavior remains unknown. Our experiments on cucumber tendrils demonstrate that tendril coiling occurs via asymmetric contraction of an internal fiber ribbon of specialized cells. Under tension, both extracted fiber ribbons and old tendrils exhibit twistless overwinding rather than unwinding, with an initially soft response followed by strong strain-stiffening at large extensions. We explain this behavior using physical models of prestrained rubber strips, geometric arguments, and mathematical models of elastic filaments. Collectively, our study illuminates the origin of tendril coiling, quantifies Darwin‚Äôs original proposal, and suggests designs for biomimetic twistless springs with tunable mechanical responses.",TRUE
How the Venus flytrap snaps,"The rapid closure of the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) leaf in about 100‚Äâms is one of the fastest movements in the plant kingdom. This led Darwin to describe the plant as ‚Äúone of the most wonderful in the world‚Äù. The trap closure is initiated by the mechanical stimulation of trigger hairs. Previous studies have focused on the biochemical response of the trigger hairs to stimuli and quantified the propagation of action potentials in the leaves. Here we complement these studies by considering the post-stimulation mechanical aspects of Venus flytrap closure. Using high-speed video imaging, non-invasive microscopy techniques and a simple theoretical model, we show that the fast closure of the trap results from a snap-buckling instability, the onset of which is controlled actively by the plant. Our study identifies an ingenious solution to scaling up movements in non-muscular engines and provides a general framework for understanding nastic motion in plants.",TRUE
How ticks get under your skin: insertion mechanics of the feeding apparatus of Ixodes ricinus ticks,"The tick Ixodes ricinus uses its mouthparts to penetrate the skin of its host and to remain attached for about a week, during which time Lyme disease spirochaetes may pass from the tick to the host. To understand how the tick achieves both tasks, penetration and attachment, with the same set of implements, we recorded the insertion events by cinematography, interpreted the mouthparts‚Äô function by scanning electron microscopy and identified their points of articulation by confocal microscopy. Our structural dynamic observations suggest that the process of insertion and attachment occurs via a ratchet-like mechanism with two distinct stages. Initially, the two telescoping chelicerae pierce the skin and, by moving alternately, generate a toehold. Subsequently, a breaststroke-like motion, effected by simultaneous flexure and retraction of both chelicerae, pulls in the barbed hypostome. This combination of a flexible, dynamic mechanical ratchet and a static holdfast thus allows the tick to solve the problem of how to penetrate skin and also remain stuck for long periods of time.",TRUE
How tussocks structure sedge meadow vegetation,"Carex stricta dominates sedge meadows in southern Wisconsin, USA. In contrast with invasive species that dominate as monotypes, C. stricta supports a diversity of co-occurring species by forming tussocks. Concerns about diversity loss and the potential to restore species-rich tussocks led us to ask how tussocks foster high species richness and affect composition. Our study of 181 tussocks at three sites showed that tussocks structure sedge meadow vegetation by adding both surface area and micro-habitats. Tussocks, which average 15‚Äì25 cm tall, increase surface area of an otherwise flat plot by 40%. Species richness was positively correlated with tussock size, but the patterns differed among sites. At a site where water was deep, tussock height was the best predictor of richness; at two other sites, surface area and circumference were the best predictors. Micro-habitats differed in conditions and species composition: tussock tops were high in light, variable in temperature, and high in litter cover. Tussock sides had less litter but more moss; off-tussock areas tended to be aquatic. Of the 56 taxa found, 34 showed significant affinities for one or more micro-habitats. Of these, four species occurred primarily on tops, several extended from tops to lower levels, seven aquatic taxa preferred areas off-tussocks, and one species specialized in tussock sides. Over the 2004 growing season, species richness increased in an additive process, from 35 species in May to 56 in September 2004. Cover of litter and moss increased and bare surface decreased with season, but only seven of the 34 taxa with micro-site preferences expanded their distributions as the September drawdown exposed the off-tussock micro-habitat. We conclude that tussocks enhance species richness in three ways, by increasing surface area, by providing multiple micro-habitats, and by undergoing seasonal changes in composition. Our detailed data on plant-diversity support by large tussocks form a benchmark for tussock meadow conservation, as well as a target for restoration of degraded meadows.",TRUE
Huddling behavior in emperor penguins: Dynamics of huddling,"Although huddling was shown to be the key by which emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) save energy and sustain their breeding fast during the Antarctic winter, the intricacies of this social behavior have been poorly studied. We recorded abiotic variables with data loggers glued to the feathers of eight individually marked emperor penguins to investigate their thermoregulatory behavior and to estimate their ""huddling time budget"" throughout the breeding season (pairing and incubation period). Contrary to the classic view, huddling episodes were discontinuous and of short and variable duration, lasting 1.6+/-1.7 (S.D.) h on average. Despite heterogeneous huddling groups, birds had equal access to the warmth of the huddles. Throughout the breeding season, males huddled for 38+/-18% (S.D.) of their time, which raised the ambient temperature that birds were exposed to above 0 degrees C (at average external temperatures of -17 degrees C). As a consequence of tight huddles, ambient temperatures were above 20 degrees C during 13+/-12% (S.D.) of their huddling time. Ambient temperatures increased up to 37.5 degrees C, close to birds' body temperature. This complex social behavior therefore enables all breeders to get a regular and equal access to an environment which allows them to save energy and successfully incubate their eggs during the Antarctic winter.",TRUE
Humidity affects the extensibility of an orb-weaving spider's viscous thread droplets,"SUMMARY The prey-capture threads found in most spider orb webs rely on viscous droplets for their stickiness. Each droplet is formed of a central mass of viscoelastic glycoprotein glue surrounded by an aqueous covering, both of which incorporate hydrophilic components. We found that the extensibility of droplets on Larinioides cornutus threads increased as humidity increased. However, the deflection of the droplets' supporting axial lines did not change, indicating that atmospheric water uptake increases glycoprotein plasticity, but not glycoprotein adhesion. The extensibility of droplets, along with that of the thread's supporting axial fibers, is responsible for summing the adhesion of multiple thread droplets. Therefore, daily changes in humidity have the potential to significantly alter the performance of viscous threads and orb webs.",TRUE
Hydraulic leg extension is not necessarily the main drive in large spiders,"SUMMARY Unlike most other arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in major leg joints. Therefore, hydraulic pressure generated in the prosoma provides leg extension. For decades, this mechanism was held responsible for the generation of the majority of the ground reaction forces, particularly in the hind legs. During propulsion, the front leg pairs must shorten whereas the hind legs have to be extended. Assuming that hind legs are essentially driven by hydraulics, their force vectors must pass the leg joints ventrally. However, at least in accelerated escape manoeuvres, we show here for the large cursorial spider species Ancylometes concolor that these force vectors, when projected into the leg plane, pass all leg joints dorsally. This indicates a reduced impact of the hydraulic mechanism on the generation of ground reaction forces. Although hydraulic leg extension still modulates their direction, the observed steep force vectors at the hind legs indicate a strong activity of flexors in the proximal joint complex that push the legs against the substrate. Consequently, the muscular mechanisms are dominant at least in the hind legs of large spiders.",TRUE
Hydrodynamic design of the humpback whale flipper,"The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is reported to use its elongate pectoral flippers during swimming maneuvers. The morphology of the flipper from a 9.02‚Äêm whale was evaluated with regard to this hydrodynamic function. The flipper had a wing‚Äêlike, high aspect ratio plan‚Äêform. Rounded tubercles were regularly interspersed along the flipper's leading edge. The flipper was cut into 71 2.5‚Äêcm cross‚Äêsections and photographed. Except for sections near the distal tip, flipper sections were symmetrical with no camber. Flipper sections had a blunt, rounded leading edge and a highly tapered trailing edge. Placement of the maximum thickness placement for each cross‚Äêsection varied from 49% of chord at the tip to 19% at mid‚Äêspan. Section thickness ratio averaged 0.23 with a range of 0.20‚Äì0.28. The humpback whale flipper had a cross‚Äêsectional design typical of manufactured aerodynamic foils for lift generation. The morphology and placement of leading edge tubercles sugges that they function as enhanced lift devices to control flow over the flipper and maintain lift at high angles of attack. The morphology of the humpback whale flipper suggests that it is adapted for high maneuverability associated with the whale's unique feeding behavior. ¬© 1995 Wiley‚ÄêLiss, Inc.",TRUE
Hydrodynamic Trail-Following in Harbor Seals (Phoca vitulina),"Marine mammals often forage in dark or turbid waters. Whereas dolphins use echolocation under such conditions, pinnipeds apparently lack this sensory ability. For seals hunting in the dark, one source of sensory information may consist of fish-generated water movements, which seals can detect with their highly sensitive whiskers. Water movements in the wake of fishes persist for several minutes. Here we show that blindfolded seals can use their whiskers to detect and accurately follow hydrodynamic trails generated by a miniature submarine. This shows that hydrodynamic information can be used for long-distance prey location.",TRUE
Hydrodynamics of sailing of the Portuguese man-of-war Physalia physalis,"Physalia physalis, commonly known as the Portuguese man-of-war (PMW), is a peculiar looking colony of specialized polyps. The most conspicuous members of this colony are the gas-filled sail-like float and the long tentacles, budding asymmetrically beneath the float. This study addresses the sailing of the PMW, and, in particular, the hydrodynamics of its trailing tentacles, the interaction between the tentacles and the float and the actual sailing performance. This paper attempts to provide answers for two of the many open questions concerning P. physalis: why does it need a sail? and how does it harness the sail?",TRUE
Hydrogen and bioenergetics in the Yellowstone geothermal ecosystem.,"The geochemical energy budgets for high-temperature microbial ecosystems such as occur at Yellowstone National Park have been unclear. To address the relative contributions of different geochemistries to the energy demands of these ecosystems, we draw together three lines of inference. We studied the phylogenetic compositions of high-temperature (>70 degrees C) communities in Yellowstone hot springs with distinct chemistries, conducted parallel chemical analyses, and carried out thermodynamic modeling. Results of extensive molecular analyses, taken with previous results, show that most microbial biomass in these systems, as reflected by rRNA gene abundance, is comprised of organisms of the kinds that derive energy for primary productivity from the oxidation of molecular hydrogen, H2. The apparent dominance by H2-metabolizing organisms indicates that H2 is the main source of energy for primary production in the Yellowstone high-temperature ecosystem. Hydrogen concentrations in the hot springs were measured and found to range up to >300 nM, consistent with this hypothesis. Thermodynamic modeling with environmental concentrations of potential energy sources also is consistent with the proposed microaerophilic, hydrogen-based energy economy for this geothermal ecosystem, even in the presence of high concentrations of sulfide.",TRUE
Hydrogen is an energy source for hydrothermal vent symbioses,"The discovery of deep-sea hydrothermal vents in 1977 revolutionized our understanding of the energy sources that fuel primary productivity on Earth. Hydrothermal vent ecosystems are dominated by animals that live in symbiosis with chemosynthetic bacteria. So far, only two energy sources have been shown to power chemosynthetic symbioses: reduced sulphur compounds and methane. Using metagenome sequencing, single-gene fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, shipboard incubations and in situ mass spectrometry, we show here that the symbionts of the hydrothermal vent mussel Bathymodiolus from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge use hydrogen to power primary production. In addition, we show that the symbionts of Bathymodiolus mussels from Pacific vents have hupL, the key gene for hydrogen oxidation. Furthermore, the symbionts of other vent animals such as the tubeworm Riftia pachyptila and the shrimp Rimicaris exoculata also have hupL. We propose that the ability to use hydrogen as an energy source is widespread in hydrothermal vent symbioses, particularly at sites where hydrogen is abundant.",TRUE
Hydromechanics and biology,"SummaryTo exemplify relations between biology and hydrodynamics the Reynolds number range and the effects of viscosity and inertia in swimming and flying organisms is discussed. Comparing water beetles and penguins it is shown, that the technical drag coefficient is an adequate means to describe flow adaptation in animals. Compared to technical systems, especially the penguins' drag coefficient is astonishingly low. Furthermore, the question, why comparatively thick bodies in penguins and dolphins show rather low drag is discussed. Distributed boundary layer damping in dolphins and secretion of special high molecular slimes in fishes help to keep flow characteristics laminar. As an example of one easily understood thrust mechanism, the drag inducing pair of rowing legs in water beetles is morphologically and hydrodynamically analysed. Fish swimming is discussed as a locomotion principle using lift components. Thrust generation by the moving tail fin of a fish is analysed in detail. Coming back to the influence if Reynolds number, it is finally shown, how very small, bristle bearing swimming legs and wings of insects make use of viscosity effects for locomotion.",TRUE
Hygromorphs: from pine cones to biomimetic bilayers,"We consider natural and artificial hygromorphs, objects that respond to environmental humidity by changing their shape. Using the pine cone as an example that opens when dried and closes when wet, we quantify the geometry, mechanics and dynamics of closure and opening at the cell, tissue and organ levels, building on our prior structural knowledge. A simple scaling theory allows us to quantify the hysteretic dynamics of opening and closing. We also show how simple bilayer hygromorphs of paper and polymer show similar behaviour that can be quantified via a theory which couples fluid transport in a porous medium and evaporative flux to mechanics and geometry. Our work unifies varied observations of natural hygromorphs and suggests interesting biomimetic analogues, which we illustrate using an artificial flower with a controllable blooming and closing response.",TRUE
Hyperacute directional hearing in a microscale auditory system,"The physics of sound propagation imposes fundamental constraints on sound localization: for a given frequency, the smaller the receiver, the smaller the available cues. Thus, the creation of nanoscale acoustic microphones with directional sensitivity is very difficult. The fly Ormia ochracea possesses an unusual 'ear' that largely overcomes these physical constraints; attempts to exploit principles derived from O. ochracea for improved hearing aids are now in progress. Here we report that O. ochracea can behaviourally localize a salient sound source with a precision equal to that of humans. Despite its small size and minuscule interaural cues, the fly localizes sound sources to within 2 degrees azimuth. As the fly's eardrums are less than 0.5 mm apart, localization cues are around 50 ns. Directional information is represented in the auditory system by the relative timing of receptor responses in the two ears. Low-jitter, phasic receptor responses are pooled to achieve hyperacute timecoding. These results demonstrate that nanoscale/microscale directional microphones patterned after O. ochracea have the potential for highly accurate directional sensitivity, independent of their size. Notably, in the fly itself this performance is dependent on a newly discovered set of specific coding strategies employed by the nervous system.",TRUE
Hypoxia and Anoxia Tolerance in the Annual Killifish Austrofundulus limnaeus.,"Embryos of the annual killifish Austrofundulus limnaeus are routinely exposed to oxygen limitation during development and are extremely tolerant of anoxia. Importantly, tolerance of anoxia is not strictly associated with entrance into metabolic dormancy associated with diapause II, but rather any embryo will respond to anoxia by entering into a state of anoxia-induced quiescence. Hypoxia causes a reduction in the rate of development, reduced heart rates, and reduced capacities for metabolic enzyme activity in both aerobic and anaerobic pathways. Embryos of A. limnaeus begin life as oxyconformers, and transition into oxyregulators near the completion of embryonic development. As this transition occurs, extreme anoxia tolerance is lost. The rate of early development is independent of oxygen partial pressure, despite the fact that the embryos are oxyconformers. This suggests a contribution from anaerobic pathways to support early development. However, the specific pathways supporting this metabolism are unknown. The response of A. limnaeus embryos to hypoxia and anoxia is unique compared to other fishes and most other vertebrates, and thus future studies on this species may lend insight into novel mechanisms that support survival during prolonged oxygen limitation.",TRUE
Hypoxic survival strategies in two fishes: extreme anoxia tolerance in the North European crucian carp and natural hypoxic preconditioning in a coral-reef shark,"SUMMARY Especially in aquatic habitats, hypoxia can be an important evolutionary driving force resulting in both convergent and divergent physiological strategies for hypoxic survival. Examining adaptations to anoxic/hypoxic survival in hypoxia-tolerant animals may offer fresh ideas for the treatment of hypoxia-related diseases. Here, we summarise our present knowledge of two fishes that have evolved to survive hypoxia under very different circumstances. The crucian carp (Carassius carassius) is of particular interest because of its extreme anoxia tolerance. During the long North European winter, it survives for months in completely oxygen-deprived freshwater habitats. The crucian carp also tolerates a few days of anoxia at room temperature and, unlike anoxia-tolerant freshwater turtles, it is still physically active in anoxia. Moreover, the crucian carp does not appear to reduce neuronal ion permeability during anoxia and may primarily rely on more subtle neuromodulatory mechanisms for anoxic metabolic depression. The epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) is a tropical marine vertebrate. It lives on shallow reef platforms that repeatedly become cut off from the ocean during periods of low tides. During nocturnal low tides, the water [O2] can fall by 80% due to respiration of the coral and associated organisms. Since the tides become lower and lower over a period of a few days, the hypoxic exposure during subsequent low tides will become progressively longer and more severe. Thus, this shark is under a natural hypoxic preconditioning regimen. Interestingly, hypoxic preconditioning lowers its metabolic rate and its critical PO2. Moreover, repeated anoxia appears to stimulate metabolic depression in an adenosine-dependent way.",TRUE
Identification and characterization of a multidomain hyperthermophilic cellulase from an archaeal enrichment.,"Despite extensive studies on microbial and enzymatic lignocellulose degradation, relatively few Archaea are known to deconstruct crystalline cellulose. Here we describe a consortium of three hyperthermophilic archaea enriched from a continental geothermal source by growth at 90 ¬∞C on crystalline cellulose, representing the first instance of Archaea able to deconstruct lignocellulose optimally above 90 ¬∞C. Following metagenomic studies on the consortium, a 90 kDa, multidomain cellulase, annotated as a member of the TIM barrel glycosyl hydrolase superfamily, was characterized. The multidomain architecture of this protein is uncommon for hyperthermophilic endoglucanases, and two of the four domains of the enzyme have no characterized homologues. The recombinant enzyme has optimal activity at 109 ¬∞C, a half-life of 5 h at 100 ¬∞C, and resists denaturation in strong detergents, high-salt concentrations, and ionic liquids. Cellulases active above 100 ¬∞C may assist in biofuel production from lignocellulosic feedstocks by hydrolysing cellulose under conditions typically employed in biomass pretreatment.",TRUE
IGF1R is an entry receptor for respiratory syncytial virus,"Pneumonia resulting from infection is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Pulmonary infection by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a large burden on human health, for which there are few therapeutic options 1 . RSV targets ciliated epithelial cells in the airways, but how viruses such as RSV interact with receptors on these cells is not understood. Nucleolin is an entry coreceptor for RSV 2 and also mediates the cellular entry of influenza, the parainfluenza virus, some enteroviruses and the bacterium that causes tularaemia 3 , 4 . Here we show a mechanism of RSV entry into cells in which outside-in signalling, involving binding of the prefusion RSV-F glycoprotein with¬†the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, triggers the activation of protein kinase C zeta (PKCŒ∂). This cellular signalling cascade recruits nucleolin from the nuclei of cells to the plasma membrane, where it also binds to RSV-F on virions. We find that inhibiting PKCŒ∂ activation prevents the trafficking of nucleolin to RSV particles on airway organoid cultures, and reduces viral replication and pathology in RSV-infected mice. These findings reveal a mechanism of virus entry in which receptor engagement and signal transduction bring the coreceptor to viral particles at the cell surface, and could form the basis of new therapeutics to treat RSV infection. Respiratory syncytial virus enters cells by binding to cell-surface IGFR1, which activates PKCŒ∂ and induces trafficking of the NCL coreceptor to the RSV particles at the cell surface.",TRUE
Immunochemical and electrophysiological analyses of magnetically responsive neurons in the mollusc Tritonia diomedea,"Tritonia diomedea uses the Earth‚Äôs magnetic field as an orientation cue, but little is known about the neural mechanisms that underlie magnetic orientation behavior in this or other animals. Six large, individually identifiable neurons in the brain of Tritonia (left and right Pd5, Pd6, Pd7) are known to respond with altered electrical activity to changes in earth-strength magnetic fields. In this study we used immunochemical, electrophysiological, and neuroanatomical techniques to investigate the function of the Pd5 neurons, the largest magnetically responsive cells. Immunocytochemical studies localized TPeps, neuropeptides isolated from Pd5, to dense-cored vesicles within the Pd5 somata and within neurites adjacent to ciliated foot epithelial cells. Anatomical analyses revealed that neurites from Pd5 are located within nerves innervating the ipsilateral foot and body wall. These results imply that Pd5 project to the foot and regulate ciliary beating through paracrine release. Electrophysiological recordings indicated that, although both LPd5 and RPd5 responded to the same magnetic stimuli, the pattern of spiking in the two cells differed. Given that TPeps increase ciliary beating and Tritonia locomotes using pedal cilia, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that Pd5 neurons control or modulate the ciliary activity involved in crawling during orientation behavior.",TRUE
Impact behaviour of freeze-dried and fresh pomelo (Citrus maxima) peel: influence of the hydration state,"Pomelos (Citrus maxima) are known for their thick peel which‚Äîinter alia‚Äîserves as energy dissipator when fruits impact on the ground after being shed. It protects the fruit from splitting open and thus enables the contained seeds to stay germinable and to potentially be dispersed by animal vectors. The main part of the peel consists of a parenchymatous tissue that can be interpreted from a materials point of view as open pored foam whose struts are pressurized and filled with liquid. In order to investigate the influence of the water content on the energy dissipation capacity, drop weight tests were conducted with fresh and with freeze-dried peel samples. Based on the coefficient of restitution it was found that freeze-drying markedly reduces the relative energy dissipation capacity of the peel. Measuring the transmitted force during impact furthermore indicated a transition from a uniform collapse of the foam-like tissue to a progressive collapse due to water extraction. Representing the peel by a Maxwell model illustrates that freeze-drying not only drastically reduces the damping function of the dashpots but also stiffens the springs of the model.",TRUE
Impact of plant shoot architecture on leaf cooling: a coupled heat and mass transfer model,"Plants display a range of striking architectural adaptations when grown at elevated temperatures. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, these include elongation of petioles, and increased petiole and leaf angles from the soil surface. The potential physiological significance of these architectural changes remains speculative. We address this issue computationally by formulating a mathematical model and performing numerical simulations, testing the hypothesis that elongated and elevated plant configurations may reflect a leaf-cooling strategy. This sets in place a new basic model of plant water use and interaction with the surrounding air, which couples heat and mass transfer within a plant to water vapour diffusion in the air, using a transpiration term that depends on saturation, temperature and vapour concentration. A two-dimensional, multi-petiole shoot geometry is considered, with added leaf-blade shape detail. Our simulations show that increased petiole length and angle generally result in enhanced transpiration rates and reduced leaf temperatures in well-watered conditions. Furthermore, our computations also reveal plant configurations for which elongation may result in decreased transpiration rate owing to decreased leaf liquid saturation. We offer further qualitative and quantitative insights into the role of architectural parameters as key determinants of leaf-cooling capacity.",TRUE
Implications of the mesophyll conductance to CO2 for photosynthesis and water-use efficiency during long-term water stress and recovery in two contrasting Eucalyptus species.,"Water stress (WS) slows growth and photosynthesis (A(n)), but most knowledge comes from short-time studies that do not account for longer term acclimation processes that are especially relevant in tree species. Using two Eucalyptus species that contrast in drought tolerance, we induced moderate and severe water deficits by withholding water until stomatal conductance (g(sw)) decreased to two pre-defined values for 24‚Äâd, WS was maintained at the target g(sw) for 29‚Äâd and then plants were re-watered. Additionally, we developed new equations to simulate the effect on mesophyll conductance (g(m)) of accounting for the resistance to refixation of CO(2). The diffusive limitations to CO(2), dominated by the stomata, were the most important constraints to A(n). Full recovery of A(n) was reached after re-watering, characterized by quick recovery of gm and even higher biochemical capacity, in contrast to the slower recovery of g(sw). The acclimation to long-term WS led to decreased mesophyll and biochemical limitations, in contrast to studies in which stress was imposed more rapidly. Finally, we provide evidence that higher gm under WS contributes to higher intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) and reduces the leaf oxidative stress, highlighting the importance of gm as a target for breeding/genetic engineering.",TRUE
Improved color constancy in honey bees enabled by parallel visual projections from dorsal ocelli,"Significance Color sensing requires a capacity to discount the changing color of natural light. We present a biologically validated mathematical solution to this classic problem based on honey bee color vision. The observed spectral tuning of two simple ocellar photoreceptors in the honey bee allows for an optimal color constancy solution to different light environments, including standard CIE (Commission Internationale de l‚ÄôEclairage) illuminations, natural forest light, sunlight, or shade. The model is fully supported by a neural pathway potentially allowing for the transfer of spectral information originating from the ocellar photoreceptors to the centralized information processing regions in the brain and explains previously observed behavioral results. This solution to color constancy can be implemented into color imaging systems to enable accurate color interpretation. How can a pollinator, like the honey bee, perceive the same colors on visited flowers, despite continuous and rapid changes in ambient illumination and background color? A hundred years ago, von Kries proposed an elegant solution to this problem, color constancy, which is currently incorporated in many imaging and technological applications. However, empirical evidence on how this method can operate on animal brains remains tenuous. Our mathematical modeling proposes that the observed spectral tuning of simple ocellar photoreceptors in the honey bee allows for the necessary input for an optimal color constancy solution to most natural light environments. The model is fully supported by our detailed description of a neural pathway allowing for the integration of signals originating from the ocellar photoreceptors to the information processing regions in the bee brain. These findings reveal a neural implementation to the classic color constancy problem that can be easily translated into artificial color imaging systems.",TRUE
In situ enrichment of microbial communities on polarized electrodes deployed in alkaline hot springs,"Abstract The discovery of the ability of microorganisms to exchange electrons with inert electrodes has triggered new areas in fundamental and applied research. However, the field is currently limited to several known electrochemically active microorganisms enriched and isolated in research laboratories. An alternative strategy is to enrich such microorganisms in their native environment by allowing them to exchange electrons with polarized solid electrodes. The use of this approach is currently limited because of a lack of available tools. We developed a low-cost, battery-operated potentiostat that is capable of controlling the potential of a working electrode and can be deployed and operated remotely, allowing the enrichment of microorganisms on electrodes in their native environment. The device was tested in four alkaline hot springs in Heart Lake Geyser Basin in Yellowstone National Park (with a temperature ranging from 45 ŒøC to 91 ŒøC and a relatively constant pH of 8.5‚Äì8.7). Microbial community analysis showed a change in microbial community structure after 32 days of polarization. The impact of polarization on microbial community was most substantial on the electrodes that generated the highest cathodic and anodic currents, suggesting a direct impact of polarization on electrode microbial community.",TRUE
In vivo muscle force and elastic energy storage during steady-speed hopping of tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii),"In order to evaluate the role of elastic energy recovery in the hopping of macropodids, in vivo measurements of muscle&shy;tendon forces using buckle force transducers attached to the tendons of the gastrocnemius (G), plantaris (PL) and flexor digitorum longus (FDL) of tammar wallabies were made as the animals hopped on a treadmill at speeds ranging from 2.1 to 6.3 m s-1. These muscles and tendons constitute the main structures that are most important in energy storage and recovery. Electromyographic recordings from the lateral gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles, together with high-speed films (200 frames s-1) and video (60 fields s-1), were also used to correlate muscle activation and kinematic patterns of limb movement with force development. On the basis of in situ calibrations of the buckle transducers, we found that muscle forces and elastic energy storage increased with increased hopping speed in all three muscle&shy;tendon units. Elastic energy recovery reached a maximum of 25 % of metabolic energy expenditure at 6.3 m s-1 and is probably greater than this at higher speeds. Force sharing among the three muscles was consistently maintained over this range of speeds in terms of recruitment. Although forces and stresses were generally comparable within the gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles, maximal tendon stresses were considerably greater in the gastrocnemius, because of its smaller cross-sectional area (peak muscle stress: 227 versus 262 kPa; peak tendon stress: 36 versus 32 MPa, G versus PL). As a result, energy storage was greatest in the gastrocnemius tendon despite its much shorter length, which limits its volume and, hence, energy storage capacity, compared with PL and FDL tendons. Forces and stresses (17 MPa maximum) developed within the FDL tendon were consistently much lower than those for the other two tendons. Peak stresses in these three tendons indicated safety factors of 3.0 for G, 3.3 for PL and 6.0 for FDL. The lower stresses developed within the tendons of the plantaris and, especially, the flexor digitorum longus may indicate the need to maintain sufficient stiffness for phalangeal control of foot placement, at the expense of reduced strain energy recovery.",TRUE
In vivo muscle force-length behavior during steady-speed hopping in tammar wallabies.,"Moderate to large macropodids can increase their speed while hopping with little or no increase in energy expenditure. This has been interpreted by some workers as resulting from elastic energy savings in their hindlimb tendons. For this to occur, the muscle fibers must transmit force to their tendons with little or no length change. To test whether this is the case, we made in vivo measurements of muscle fiber length change and tendon force in the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and plantaris (PL) muscles of tammar wallabies Macropus eugenii as they hopped at different speeds on a treadmill. Muscle fiber length changes were less than +/-0.5 mm in the plantaris and +/-2.2 mm in the lateral gastrocnemius, representing less than 2 % of total fiber length in the plantaris and less than 6 % in the lateral gastrocnemius, with respect to resting length. The length changes of the plantaris fibers suggest that this occurred by means of elastic extension of attached cross-bridges. Much of the length change in the lateral gastrocnemius fibers occurred at low force early in the stance phase, with generally isometric behavior at higher forces. Fiber length changes did not vary significantly with increased hopping speed in either muscle (P>0.05), despite a 1. 6-fold increase in muscle-tendon force between speeds of 2.5 and 6.0 m s-1. Length changes of the PL fibers were only 7+/-4 % and of the LG fibers 34+/-12 % (mean +/- S.D., N=170) of the stretch calculated for their tendons, resulting in little net work by either muscle (plantaris 0.01+/-0.03 J; gastrocnemius -0.04+/-0.30 J; mean +/- s.d. ). In contrast, elastic strain energy stored in the tendons increased with increasing speed and averaged 20-fold greater than the shortening work performed by the two muscles. These results show that an increasing amount of strain energy stored within the hindlimb tendons is usefully recovered at faster steady hopping speeds, without being dissipated by increased stretch of the muscles' fibers. This finding supports the view that tendon elastic saving of energy is an important mechanism by which this species is able to hop at faster speeds with little or no increase in metabolic energy expenditure.",TRUE
In vivo strains in pigeon flight feather shafts: implications for structural design,"To evaluate the safety factor for flight feather shafts, in vivo strains were recorded during free flight from the dorsal surface of a variety of flight feathers of captive pigeons (Columba livia) using metal foil strain gauges. Strains recorded while the birds flew at a slow speed (approximately 5-6 m s-1) were used to calculate functional stresses on the basis of published values for the elastic modulus of feather keratin. These stresses were then compared with measurements of the failure stress obtained from four-point bending tests of whole sections of the rachis at a similar location. Recorded strains followed an oscillatory pattern, changing from tensile strain during the upstroke to compressive strain during the downstroke. Peak compressive strains were 2.2+/-0. 9 times (mean +/- s.d.) greater than peak tensile strains. Tensile strain peaks were generally not as large in more proximal flight feathers. Maximal compressive strains averaged -0.0033+/-0.0012 and occurred late in the downstroke. Bending tests demonstrated that feather shafts are most likely to fail through local buckling of their compact keratin cortex. A comparison of the mean (8.3 MPa) and maximum (15.7 MPa) peak stresses calculated from the in vivo strain recordings with the mean failure stress measured in four-point bending (137 MPa) yields a safety factor of between 9 and 17. Under more strenuous flight conditions, feather stresses are estimated to be 1.4-fold higher, reducing their safety factor to the range 6-12. These values seem high, considering that the safety factor of the humerus of pigeons has been estimated to be between 1.9 and 3.5. Several hypotheses explaining this difference in safety factor are considered, but the most reasonable explanation appears to be that flexural stiffness is more critical than strength to feather shaft performance.",TRUE
Incidence and mechanical significance of pneumatization in the long bones of birds,"The incidence of pneumatization in avian long bones was studied, by direct observation, in a large sample of species. Only proximal bones (humerus and femur) presented pneumatization in the sample studied. The incidence obtained was related to the variation of the maximum cortical thickness and mechanical properties, such as bending strength and flexural Young's modulus. Cortical thickness, bending strength and flexural Young's modulus were significantly lower in pneumatized bones than in marrow-filled bones. Furthermore, some congruence was found between pneumatization and systematic groups when compared. In this sense, Charadriformes was the only order studied with total absence of long bone pneumatization. Results on cortical thickness appear to be in agreement with modelling predictions previously made and with results obtained on other groups of flying vertebrates. The possible selective advantage of reduction in cortical thickness in relation to flying is suggested.",TRUE
Increased Food and Ecosystem Security via Perennial Grains,"Perennial grains hold promise, especially for marginal landscapes or with limited resources where annual versions struggle. Despite doubling of yields of major grain crops since the 1950s, more than one in seven people suffer from malnutrition (1). Global population is growing; demand for food, especially meat, is increasing; much land most suitable for annual crops is already in use; and production of nonfood goods (e.g., biofuels) increasingly competes with food production for land (2). The best lands have soils at low or moderate risk of degradation under annual grain production but make up only 12.6% of global land area (16.5 million km2) (3). Supporting more than 50% of world population is another 43.7 million km2 of marginal lands (33.5% of global land area), at high risk of degradation under annual grain production but otherwise capable of producing crops (3). Global food security depends on annual grains‚Äîcereals, oilseeds, and legumes‚Äîplanted on almost 70% of croplands, which combined supply a similar portion of human calories (4, 5). Annual grain production, though, often compromises essential ecosystem services, pushing some beyond sustainable boundaries (5). To ensure food and ecosystem security, farmers need more options to produce grains under different, generally less favorable circumstances than those under which increases in food security were achieved this past century. Development of perennial versions of important grain crops could expand options.",TRUE
Induced Drag Savings From Ground Effect and Formation Flight in Brown Pelicans,"Cin√© films of brown pelicans flying in formation were used to measure altitudes and wing tip spacing (WTS, distance perpendicular to the flight path between wing tips of adjacent birds at maximum span) for birds flying in ground effect, and vertical displacements and WTS for birds flying out of ground effect. Views were near coplanar with the plane of flight paths, and maximum wing span was used for scale. Induced drag savings in ground effect averaged 49% for gliding. Average WTS varied considerably with no evidence for systematic positioning near an optimum. There were also no differences in average WTS between flapping and gliding in or out of ground effect. Vertical displacements out of ground effect varied less than WTS but more than vertical displacements in ground effect. Few birds had wing beat frequencies similar to the bird ahead as would be needed to track vertical variation in trailing wing tip vortex positions. Imprecision in WTS may be due to unpredictable flow fields in ground effect, and difficulty in maintaining position under windy conditions out of ground effect.",TRUE
Induced niche shift as an anti-predator response for an endoparasitoid,"When two developmental stages do not share the same ecological niche, the control of the niche shift through a change in developmental timing, referred to as ‚Äòheterokairy‚Äô, can provide an adaptive advantage for the individual (e.g. if mortality risk is higher in the first niche). For endoparasitic species that develop inside another (host) species, mortality of the host may directly induce mortality risk for the parasite. Thus, endoparasitoid larvae should be selected for response to host predation. In this study, aphids previously parasitized by the endoparasitoid Endaphis fugitiva, Gagn√© and Muratori (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), were experimentally exposed to increased mortality risks. Both simulated attack and actual predator attacks against aphid hosts induced early emergence of the parasitoid larvae. Parasitoid emergence from the aphids occurred several minutes before the predator finished feeding on the aphid, allowing enough time for the parasitoid larvae to avoid direct predation. Predator-induced emergence produced significantly smaller parasitoid larvae than controls, but, interestingly, no effect on Endaphis adult size was found. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of induced emergence in an insect parasitoid, but we suggest that this mechanism might be at work in many other species where plasticity in development time allows the individual to perform an adaptive niche shift.",TRUE
Induced production of antifungal naphthoquinones in the pitchers of the carnivorous plant Nepenthes khasiana,"Nepenthes spp. are carnivorous plants that have developed insect capturing traps, evolved by specific modification of the leaf tips, and are able to utilize insect degradation products as nutritional precursors. A chitin-induced antifungal ability, based on the production and secretion to the trap liquid of droserone and 5-O-methyldroserone, is described here. Such specific secretion uniquely occurred when chitin injection was used as the eliciting agent and probably reflects a certain kind of defence mechanism that has been evolved for protecting the carnivory-based provision of nutritional precursors. The pitcher liquid containing droserone and 5-O-methyldroserone at 3:1 or 4:1 molar ratio, as well as the purified naphthoquinones, exerted an antifungal effect on a wide range of plant and human fungal pathogens. When tested against Candida and Aspergillus spp., the concentrations required for achieving inhibitory and fungicidal effects were significantly lower than those causing cytotoxicity in cells of the human embryonic kidney cell line, 293T. These naturally secreted 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives, that are assumed to act via semiquinone enhancement of free radical production, may offer a new lead to develop alternative antifungal drugs with reduced selectable pressure for potentially evolved resistance.",TRUE
Inferring the rules of interaction of shoaling fish,"Collective motion, where large numbers of individuals move synchronously together, is achieved when individuals adopt interaction rules that determine how they respond to their neighbors‚Äô movements and positions. These rules determine how group-living animals move, make decisions, and transmit information between individuals. Nonetheless, few studies have explicitly determined these interaction rules in moving groups, and very little is known about the interaction rules of fish. Here, we identify three key rules for the social interactions of mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki): (i) Attraction forces are important in maintaining group cohesion, while we find only weak evidence that fish align with their neighbor‚Äôs orientation; (ii) repulsion is mediated principally by changes in speed; (iii) although the positions and directions of all shoal members are highly correlated, individuals only respond to their single nearest neighbor. The last two of these rules are different from the classical models of collective animal motion, raising new questions about how fish and other animals self-organize on the move.",TRUE
Information can explain the dynamics of group order in animal collective behaviour,"Animal groups vary in their collective order (or state), forming disordered swarms to highly polarized groups. One explanation for this variation is that individuals face differential benefits or costs depending on the group‚Äôs order, but empirical evidence for this is lacking. Here we show that in three-spined sticklebacks ( Gasterosteus aculeatus ), fish that are first to respond to an ephemeral food source do so faster when shoals are in a disordered, swarm-like state. This is because individuals‚Äô visual fields collectively cover more of their environment, meaning private information is more readily available in disordered groups. Once social information becomes available, however, the arrival times of subsequent group members to the food are faster in more ordered, polarized groups. Our data further suggest that first responding individuals (those that benefit from group disorder) maintain larger differences in heading angle to their nearest neighbours when shoaling, thereby explaining how conflict over whether private or social information is favoured can drive dynamic changes in collective behaviour. In animal groups, the degree of alignment of individuals could have different benefits and costs for individuals depending on their reliance on private or social information. Here the authors show that in shoals of three-spined sticklebacks, some individuals reach resources faster when groups are disordered, a state which favours reliance on privately acquired information, while other individuals reach resources faster when groups are ordered, allowing them to exploit social information more effectively.",TRUE
Inhibiting bacterial cooperation is an evolutionarily robust anti-biofilm strategy,"Bacteria commonly form dense biofilms encased in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Biofilms are often extremely tolerant to antimicrobials but their reliance on shared EPS may also be a weakness as social evolution theory predicts that inhibiting shared traits can select against resistance. Here we show that EPS of Salmonella biofilms is a cooperative trait whose benefit is shared among cells, and that EPS inhibition reduces both cell attachment and antimicrobial tolerance. We then compare an EPS inhibitor to conventional antimicrobials in an evolutionary experiment. While resistance against conventional antimicrobials rapidly evolves, we see no evolution of resistance to EPS inhibition. We further show that a resistant strain is outcompeted by a susceptible strain under EPS inhibitor treatment, explaining why resistance does not evolve. Our work suggests that targeting cooperative traits is a viable solution to the problem of antimicrobial resistance. Bacterial biofilms rely on shared extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and are often highly tolerant to antibiotics. Here, the authors show in in vitro experiments that Salmonella does not evolve resistance to EPS inhibition because such strains are outcompeted by a susceptible strain under inhibitor treatment.",TRUE
"Insect aquaplaning: Nepenthes pitcher plants capture prey with the peristome, a fully wettable water-lubricated anisotropic surface.","Pitcher plants of the genus Nepenthes have highly specialized leaves adapted to attract, capture, retain, and digest arthropod prey. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the capture of insects, ranging from slippery epicuticular wax crystals to downward-pointing lunate cells and alkaloid secretions that anesthetize insects. Here we report that perhaps the most important capture mechanism has thus far remained overlooked. It is based on special surface properties of the pitcher rim (peristome) and insect ""aquaplaning."" The peristome is characterized by a regular microstructure with radial ridges of smooth overlapping epidermal cells, which form a series of steps toward the pitcher inside. This surface is completely wettable by nectar secreted at the inner margin of the peristome and by rain water, so that homogenous liquid films cover the surface under humid weather conditions. Only when wet, the peristome surface is slippery for insects, so that most ant visitors become trapped. By measuring friction forces of weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) on the peristome surface of Nepenthes bicalcarata, we demonstrate that the two factors preventing insect attachment to the peristome, i.e., water lubrication and anisotropic surface topography, are effective against different attachment structures of the insect tarsus. Peristome water films disrupt attachment only for the soft adhesive pads but not for the claws, whereas surface topography leads to anisotropic friction only for the claws but not for the adhesive pads. Experiments on Nepenthes alata show that the trapping mechanism of the peristome is also essential in Nepenthes species with waxy inner pitcher walls.",TRUE
Insect communication: ‚ÄòNo entry‚Äô signal in ant foraging,"Forager ants lay attractive trail pheromones to guide nestmates to food, but the effectiveness of foraging networks might be improved if pheromones could also be used to repel foragers from unrewarding routes. Here we present empirical evidence for such a negative trail pheromone, deployed by Pharaoh's ants (Monomorium pharaonis) as a ‚Äòno entry‚Äô signal to mark an unrewarding foraging path. This finding constitutes another example of the sophisticated control mechanisms used in self-organized ant colonies.",TRUE
Insect eggs protected from high temperatures by limited homeothermy of plant leaves,"SUMMARY Virtually all aspects of insect biology are affected by body temperature, and many taxa have evolved sophisticated temperature-control mechanisms. All insects, however, begin life as eggs and lack the ability to thermoregulate. Eggs laid on leaves experience a thermal environment, and thus a body temperature, that is strongly influenced by the leaves themselves. Because plants can maintain leaf temperatures that differ from ambient, e.g. by evapotranspiration, plant hosts may protect eggs from extreme ambient temperatures. We examined the degree to which leaves buffer ambient thermal variation and whether that buffering benefits leaf-associated insect eggs. In particular, we: (1) measured temperature variation at oviposition sites in the field, (2) manipulated temperatures in the laboratory to determine the effect of different thermal conditions on embryo development time and survival, and (3) tested embryonic metabolic rates over increasing temperatures. Our results show that Datura wrightii leaves buffer Manduca sexta eggs from fatally high ambient temperatures in the southwestern USA. Moreover, small differences in temperature profiles among leaves can cause large variation in egg metabolic rate and development time. Specifically, large leaves were hotter than small leaves during the day, reaching temperatures that are stressfully high for eggs. This study provides the first mechanistic demonstration of how this type of leaf-constructed thermal refuge interacts with egg physiology.",TRUE
Insect metabolism: Preventing cyanide release from leaves,"Organisms that produce hydrogen cyanide gas to protect themselves against predators can do so by the enzymatic breakdown of a class of compounds known as cyanogens (such as cyanogenic glycosides). Here we show how a neotropical butterfly, Heliconius sara, can avoid the harmful effects of the cyanogenic leaves of Passiflora auriculata (passion vine), on which its larvae feed exclusively. To our knowledge this is the first example of an insect that is able to metabolize cyanogens and thereby prevent the release of cyanide. The mechanistic details of this pathway might suggest new ways to make cyanogenic crops more useful as a food source.",TRUE
Insect tricks: two-phasic foot pad secretion prevents slipping,"Many insects cling to vertical and inverted surfaces with pads that adhere by nanometre-thin films of liquid secretion. This fluid is an emulsion, consisting of watery droplets in an oily continuous phase. The detailed function of its two-phasic nature has remained unclear. Here we show that the pad emulsion provides a mechanism that prevents insects from slipping on smooth substrates. We discovered that it is possible to manipulate the adhesive secretion in vivo using smooth polyimide substrates that selectively absorb its watery component. While thick layers of polyimide spin-coated onto glass removed all visible hydrophilic droplets, thin coatings left the emulsion in its typical form. Force measurements of stick insect pads sliding on these substrates demonstrated that the reduction of the watery phase resulted in a significant decrease in friction forces. Artificial control pads made of polydimethylsiloxane showed no difference when tested on the same substrates, confirming that the effect is caused by the insects‚Äô fluid-based adhesive system. Our findings suggest that insect adhesive pads use emulsions with non-Newtonian properties, which may have been optimized by natural selection. Emulsions as adhesive secretions combine the benefits of ‚Äòwet‚Äô adhesion and resistance against shear forces.",TRUE
Insects had it first: surfactants as a defence against predators,"Insects have evolved an astonishing array of defences to ward off enemies. Well known and widespread is the regurgitation of oral secretion (OS), fluid that repels attacking predators. In herbivores, the effectiveness of OS has been ascribed so far to the presence of deterrent secondary metabolites sequestered from the host plant. This notion implies, however, that generalists experience less protection on plants with low amounts of secondary metabolites or with compounds ineffective against potential enemies. Resolving the dilemma, we describe a novel defence mechanism that is independent of deterrents as it relies on the intrinsic detergent properties of the OS. The OS of Spodoptera exigua (and other species) was found to be highly amphiphilic and well capable of wetting the hydrophobic cuticle of predatory ants. As a result, affected ants stopped attacking and engaged in extensive cleansing. The presence of surfactants was sufficient to explain the defensive character of herbivore OS. We hypothesize that detergency is a common but unrecognized mode of defence, which provides a base level of protection that may or may not be further enhanced by plant-derived deterrents. Our study also proves that insects ‚Äòinvented‚Äô the use of defensive surfactants long before modern agriculture had started applying them as insecticides.",TRUE
Integrative biomechanics for tree ecology: beyond wood density and strength.,"Functional ecology has long considered the support function as important, but its biomechanical complexity is only just being elucidated. We show here that it can be described on the basis of four biomechanical traits, two safety traits against winds and self-buckling, and two motricity traits involved in sustaining an upright position, tropic motion velocity (MV) and posture control (PC). All these traits are integrated at the tree scale, combining tree size and shape together with wood properties. The assumption of trait constancy has been used to derive allometric scaling laws, but it was more recently found that observing their variations among environments and functional groups, or during ontogeny, provides more insights into adaptive syndromes of tree shape and wood properties. However, oversimplified expressions have often been used, possibly concealing key adaptive drivers. An extreme case of oversimplification is the use of wood basic density as a proxy for safety. Actually, as wood density is involved in stiffness, loads, and construction costs, the impact of its variations on safety is non-trivial. Moreover, other wood features, especially the microfibril angle (MFA), are also involved. Furthermore, wood is not only stiff and strong, but it also acts as a motor for MV and PC. The relevant wood trait for this is maturation strain asymmetry. Maturation strains vary with cell-wall characteristics such as MFA, rather than with wood density. Finally, the need for further studies about the ecological relevance of branching patterns, motricity traits, and growth responses to mechanical loads is discussed.",TRUE
Interaction of liquid epicuticular hydrocarbons and tarsal adhesive secretion in Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae),"Species of various insect orders possess specialised tarsal adhesive structures covered by a thin liquid film, which is deposited in the form of footprints. This adhesive liquid has been suggested to be chemically and physiologically related to the epicuticular lipid layer, which naturally covers the body of insects and acts as the prime barrier to environmental stresses, such as desiccation. The functional efficiency of the layer, however, is jeopardised by partial melting that may occur at physiological temperatures. In this study, light microscopic images of elytral prints show that the epicuticular lipid layer of the Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata actually is partially liquid and chemical investigations reveal the high similarity of the epicuticular hydrocarbon pattern and the tarsal liquid. By means of chemical manipulation of the surface hydrocarbon composition of live beetles, the substance exchange between their tarsal adhesive hairs and the body surface is monitored. Histological sections of L. decemlineata tarsi, furthermore, reveal glandular cells connected to individual adhesive setae and departing from these results, an idea of a general mechanism of tarsal secretion is developed and discussed in a functional‚Äìecological context.",TRUE
Interaction of two myosins with microfilaments causes locomotion inLabyrinthula sp.,"SummaryCytoskeleton elements of aLabyrinthula isolate from the Falkland Islands were studied. The most important characteristic of the genusLabyrinthula is a colourless branched plasmatic network of pseudopodia-like tubes with sliding spindle-shaped uninuclear plasma portions (cell bodies). After fluorescent staining tubulin appears to be uniformly and diffusely distributed throughout the whole network and to form a reticulate structure in the cell bodies. The inhibitor colchicine has no influence on the sliding motility of the cell bodies nor on the movement of the network. Actin is frequently found in the network, partly in the form of microfilament bundles, which are longitudinally arranged. Actin is also present in the cortical region of cell bodies, or of cell body groups. It was difficult to distinguish single cell bodies within groups by fluorescence. The inhibitors cytochalasin B and D stop the movement of cell bodies and network. Myosin is present in the cortical region of each cell body, and the central portions of each individual cell body contain accumulations of this protein. We could not observe any fluorescence in the network after myosin staining with the antibodies we used. An actin-myosin complex is probably responsible for the sliding movement of cell bodies in the Labyrinthula network, because actin is found in the pseudopodia-like tubes, and the cortex of the cell bodies is rich in actin and myosin. This actin-myosin complex seems to differ from another actin-myosin complex that has been postulated to be responsible for the locomotion of pseudopodia-like tubes. We propose that two actin-myosin complexes exist. One of them is responsible for locomotory phenomena of the network, and the second for cell body sliding in the pseudopodia-like tubes. In each case the myosin is probably anchored in the inner matrix membrane of the pseudopodia-like tubes. A model for actin-myosin interaction inLabyrinthula spp. is presented.",TRUE
Interactions between social groups of colobus monkeys (Colobus vellerosus) explain similarities in their gut microbiomes,"The gut microbiome is structured by social groups in a variety of host taxa. Whether this pattern is driven by relatedness, similar diets or shared social environments is under debate because few studies have had access to the data necessary to disentangle these factors in wild populations. We investigated whether diet, relatedness or the 1¬†m proximity network best explains differences in the gut microbiome among 45 female colobus monkeys in eight social groups residing at Boabeng-Fiema, Ghana. We combined demographic and behavioural data collected during May ‚Äì August 2007 and October 2008 ‚Äì April 2009 with 16S rRNA sequencing of faecal samples collected during the latter part of each observation period. Depending on the beta diversity index, social group identity explained 19‚Äì28% of the variation in gut microbiome beta diversity. When comparing the predictive power of dietary dissimilarity, relatedness and connectedness in the 1¬†m proximity network, the models with social connectedness received the strongest support, even in our analyses that excluded within-group dyads. This novel finding indicates that microbes may be transmitted during intergroup encounters, which could occur either indirectly via shared environments or directly via social contact. Lastly, some of the gut microbial taxa that appear to be transmitted via 1¬†m proximity are associated with digestion of plant material. Further research is needed to investigate whether this type of gut microbe transmission yields health benefits, which could provide an incentive for the formation and maintenance of social bonds within and between social groups.",TRUE
Intertidal ‚Äútrees‚Äù: consequences of aggregation on the mechanical and photosynthetic properties of sea-palms Postelsia palmaeformis Ruprecht,"Sea-palms Postelsia palmaeformis Ruprecht are annual brown algae that grow on wave-swept rocky shores, oRen forming dense stands. Unlike most macroalgae, Postelsia stands upright in air- like trees. The stipe flexibility that permits Postelsia to withstand waves is provided by the low elastic modulus (5-10 MPa) of stipe tissue; in spite of the weakness (low breaking stress, ~ 1 MPa) of this tissue, a large amount of energy ( ~ 100 kJ/m 3) is required to break a stipe because they can be extended by 20-25 % before breaking. Although made of such easily deformed tissue, Postelsia can stand upright in air due to the width (high second moment of area) and resilience of their stipes, but the brittleness (low work of fracture, 400-900 J/m 2) that accompanies this resilience renders them susceptible to bre~age if they sustain deep scratches. Although wave-induced stresses experienced by individuals in aggregations are not lower than those experienced by isolated sea-palms, photon flux densities of photosynthetically active radiation within these dense groves are less than 10% of those above Postelsia canopies. A number of morphological features differ between canopy, understory, and isolated individuals. Canopy plants in dense aggregations are taller than isolated individuals and may exceed limiting proportions for elastic stability. Postelsia shows photo- synthetic characteristics of""shade-adapted"" plants, understory individuals being especially effective at using low light. Despite this, blade growth rates of understory plants are lower than those of either canopy or isolated individuals.",TRUE
Intracellular invasion of green algae in a salamander host,"The association between embryos of the spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) and green algae (‚ÄúOophila amblystomatis‚Äù Lamber ex Printz) has been considered an ectosymbiotic mutualism. We show here, however, that this symbiosis is more intimate than previously reported. A combination of imaging and algal 18S rDNA amplification reveals algal invasion of embryonic salamander tissues and cells during development. Algal cells are detectable from embryonic and larval Stages 26‚Äì44 through chlorophyll autofluorescence and algal 18S rDNA amplification. Algal cell ultrastructure indicates both degradation and putative encystment during the process of tissue and cellular invasion. Fewer algal cells were detected in later-stage larvae through FISH, suggesting that the decline in autofluorescent cells is primarily due to algal cell death within the host. However, early embryonic egg capsules also contained encysted algal cells on the inner capsule wall, and algal 18S rDNA was amplified from adult reproductive tracts, consistent with oviductal transmission of algae from one salamander generation to the next. The invasion of algae into salamander host tissues and cells represents a unique association between a vertebrate and a eukaryotic alga, with implications for research into cell‚Äìcell recognition, possible exchange of metabolites or DNA, and potential congruence between host and symbiont population structures.",TRUE
Intraspecific Directed Deterrence by the Mustard Oil Bomb in a Desert Plant,"Plant secondary metabolites (SMs) acting as defensive chemicals in reproductive organs such as fruit tissues play roles in both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions between plants and seed dispersers/predators [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The directed-deterrence hypothesis states that SMs in ripe fruits deter seed predators but have little or no effect on seed dispersers [6]. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that birds are able to cope with fruit SMs whereas rodents are deterred by them [1, 7]. However, this mechanism was only demonstrated at the class level, i.e., between birds and mammals, based on differences in the vanilloid receptors [7]. Here we present experimental and behavioral data demonstrating the use of the broad-range, class-independent ‚Äúmustard oil bomb‚Äù mechanism in Ochradenus baccatus fruits to force a behavioral change at an ecological timescale, converting rodents from seed predators to seed dispersers. This is achieved by a unique compartmentalization of the mustard oil bomb, causing activation of the system only upon seed and pulp coconsumption, encouraging seed dispersal via seed spitting by rodents. Our findings demonstrate the power of SMs to shift the animal-plant relationship from predation to mutualism and provide support for the directed-deterrence hypothesis at the intraspecific level, in addition to the interspecific level.",TRUE
Investigation of hindwing folding in ladybird beetles by artificial elytron transplantation and microcomputed tomography,"Significance Hindwings in ladybird beetles successfully achieve compatibility between the deformability (instability) required for wing folding and strength property (stability) required for flying. This study demonstrates how ladybird beetles address these two conflicting requirements by an unprecedented technique using artificial wings. Our results, which clarify the detailed wing-folding process and reveal the supporting structures, provide indispensable initial knowledge for revealing this naturally evolved optimization system. Investigating the characteristics in the venations and crease patterns revealed in this study could provide an innovative designing method, enabling the integration of structural stability and deformability, and thus could have a considerable impact on engineering science. Ladybird beetles are high-mobility insects and explore broad areas by switching between walking and flying. Their excellent wing transformation systems enabling this lifestyle are expected to provide large potential for engineering applications. However, the mechanism behind the folding of their hindwings remains unclear. The reason is that ladybird beetles close the elytra ahead of wing folding, preventing the observation of detailed processes occurring under the elytra. In the present study, artificial transparent elytra were transplanted on living ladybird beetles, thereby enabling us to observe the detailed wing-folding processes. The result revealed that in addition to the abdominal movements mentioned in previous studies, the edge and ventral surface of the elytra, as well as characteristic shaped veins, play important roles in wing folding. The structures of the wing frames enabling this folding process and detailed 3D shape of the hindwing were investigated using microcomputed tomography. The results showed that the tape spring-like elastic frame plays an important role in the wing transformation mechanism. Compared with other beetles, hindwings in ladybird beetles are characterized by two seemingly incompatible properties: (i) the wing rigidity with relatively thick veins and (ii) the compactness in stored shapes with complex crease patterns. The detailed wing-folding process revealed in this study is expected to facilitate understanding of the naturally optimized system in this excellent deployable structure.",TRUE

"Investigation of microstructure, natural frequencies and vibration modes of dragonfly wing","In the present work, a thorough investigation on the microstructural and morphological aspects of dragonfly wings was carried out using scanning electron microscope. Then, based on this study and the previous reports, a precise three-dimensional numerical model was developed and natural frequencies and vibration modes of dragonfly forewing were determined by finite element method. The results shown that dragonfly wings are made of a series of adaptive materials, which form a very complex composite structure. This bio-composite fabrication has some unique features and potential benefits. Furthermore, the numerical results show that the first natural frequency of dragonfly wings is about 168 Hz and bending is the predominant deformation mode in this stage. The accuracy of the present analysis is verified by comparison of calculated results with experimental data. This paper may be helpful for micro aerial vehicle design concerning dynamic response.",TRUE
Ionizing Radiation Changes the Electronic Properties of Melanin and Enhances the Growth of Melanized Fungi,"Background Melanin pigments are ubiquitous in nature. Melanized microorganisms are often the dominating species in certain extreme environments, such as soils contaminated with radionuclides, suggesting that the presence of melanin is beneficial in their life cycle. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation could change the electronic properties of melanin and might enhance the growth of melanized microorganisms. Methodology/Principal Findings Ionizing irradiation changed the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal of melanin, consistent with changes in electronic structure. Irradiated melanin manifested a 4-fold increase in its capacity to reduce NADH relative to non-irradiated melanin. HPLC analysis of melanin from fungi grown on different substrates revealed chemical complexity, dependence of melanin composition on the growth substrate and possible influence of melanin composition on its interaction with ionizing radiation. XTT/MTT assays showed increased metabolic activity of melanized C. neoformans cells relative to non-melanized cells, and exposure to ionizing radiation enhanced the electron-transfer properties of melanin in melanized cells. Melanized Wangiella dermatitidis and Cryptococcus neoformans cells exposed to ionizing radiation approximately 500 times higher than background grew significantly faster as indicated by higher CFUs, more dry weight biomass and 3-fold greater incorporation of 14C-acetate than non-irradiated melanized cells or irradiated albino mutants. In addition, radiation enhanced the growth of melanized Cladosporium sphaerospermum cells under limited nutrients conditions. Conclusions/Significance Exposure of melanin to ionizing radiation, and possibly other forms of electromagnetic radiation, changes its electronic properties. Melanized fungal cells manifested increased growth relative to non-melanized cells after exposure to ionizing radiation, raising intriguing questions about a potential role for melanin in energy capture and utilization.",TRUE
Iridescence impairs object recognition in bumblebees,"Iridescence is a taxonomically widespread and striking form of animal coloration, yet despite advances in understanding its mechanism, its function and adaptive value are poorly understood. We test a counterintuitive hypothesis about the function of iridescence: that it can act as camouflage through interference with object recognition. Using an established insect visual model (Bombus terrestris), we demonstrate that both diffraction grating and multilayer iridescence impair shape recognition (although not the more subtle form of diffraction grating seen in some flowers), supporting the idea that both strategies can be effective means of camouflage. We conclude that iridescence produces visual signals that can confuse potential predators, and this might explain the high frequency of iridescence in many animal taxa.",TRUE
Iridescence: a functional perspective,"In animals, iridescence is generated by the interaction of light with biological tissues that are nanostructured to produce thin films or diffraction gratings. Uniquely among animal visual signals, the study of iridescent coloration contributes to biological and physical sciences by enhancing our understanding of the evolution of communication strategies, and by providing insights into physical optics and inspiring biomimetic technologies useful to humans. Iridescent colours are found in a broad diversity of animal taxa ranging from diminutive marine copepods to terrestrial insects and birds. Iridescent coloration has received a surge of research interest of late, and studies have focused on both characterizing the nanostructures responsible for producing iridescence and identifying the behavioural functions of iridescent colours. In this paper, we begin with a brief description of colour production mechanisms in animals and provide a general overview of the taxonomic distribution of iridescent colours. We then highlight unique properties of iridescent signals and review the proposed functions of iridescent coloration, focusing, in particular, on the ways in which iridescent colours allow animals to communicate with conspecifics and avoid predators. We conclude with a brief overview of non-communicative functions of iridescence in animals. Despite the vast amount of recent work on animal iridescence, our review reveals that many proposed functions of iridescent coloration remain virtually unexplored, and this area is clearly ripe for future research.",TRUE
Iron conservation by reduction of metalloenzyme inventories in the marine diazotroph Crocosphaera watsonii,"The marine nitrogen fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) are a major source of nitrogen to open ocean ecosystems and are predicted to be limited by iron in most marine environments. Here we use global and targeted proteomic analyses on a key unicellular marine diazotroph Crocosphaera watsonii to reveal large scale diel changes in its proteome, including substantial variations in concentrations of iron metalloproteins involved in nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis, as well as nocturnal flavodoxin production. The daily synthesis and degradation of enzymes in coordination with their utilization results in a lowered cellular metalloenzyme inventory that requires ‚àº40% less iron than if these enzymes were maintained throughout the diel cycle. This strategy is energetically expensive, but appears to serve as an important adaptation for confronting the iron scarcity of the open oceans. A global numerical model of ocean circulation, biogeochemistry and ecosystems suggests that Crocosphaera‚Äôs ability to reduce its iron-metalloenzyme inventory provides two advantages: It allows Crocosphaera to inhabit regions lower in iron and allows the same iron supply to support higher Crocosphaera biomass and nitrogen fixation than if they did not have this reduced iron requirement.",TRUE
Iron-Clad Fibers: A Metal-Based Biological Strategy for Hard Flexible Coatings,"Mussel Fibers While it is possible to make strong fibers or threads from organic materials, most suffer from high wear abrasion. Marine mussels attach themselves to rocky seashores using a series of byssal threads. Despite the constant rubbing caused by the motion of the tides, the threads show high wear resistance. Harrington et al. (p. 216, published online 4 March; see the Perspective by Messersmith) now find that the threads are protected by a proteinaceous outer cuticle that is rich in the amino acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa), which is known to be a strong adhesive. The cuticle is also rich in metal ions, primarily Fe3+. The dopa-metal crosslinks helped to form the tough outer coating. Marine mussel byssal threads have an outer coating in which proteins are linked to metal ions. The extensible byssal threads of marine mussels are shielded from abrasion in wave-swept habitats by an outer cuticle that is largely proteinaceous and approximately fivefold harder than the thread core. Threads from several species exhibit granular cuticles containing a protein that is rich in the catecholic amino acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) as well as inorganic ions, notably Fe3+. Granular cuticles exhibit a remarkable combination of high hardness and high extensibility. We explored byssus cuticle chemistry by means of in situ resonance Raman spectroscopy and demonstrated that the cuticle is a polymeric scaffold stabilized by catecholato-iron chelate complexes having an unusual clustered distribution. Consistent with byssal cuticle chemistry and mechanics, we present a model in which dense cross-linking in the granules provides hardness, whereas the less cross-linked matrix provides extensibility.",TRUE
Irregular fog as a water source for desert dune beetles,"SummaryThree methods of fog-water uptake have been observed in three tribes of Namib desert dune tenebrionid beetles, Adesmiini, Eurychorini and Zophosini. The methods used correlate with distribution and gross morphology of each species but cut across phylogenetic affinities. Of the three methods described, none involve obvious fine anatomical or physical adaptations of the beetles for fog-water uptake. Rather, the beetles have evolved specific behavioural patterns for drinking water condensed on vegetation, their own dorsum or sand.Use of fog-water necessitates surface activity at times when surface temperatures and wind velocities are not optimal for these diurnal or crepuscular species. Behavioural adaptation has enabled these beetles to use irregular and unpredictable fogs as a moisture source.",TRUE
Jackrabbit ears: surface temperatures and vascular responses.,"Blood flow to the ear pinnae is curtailed at ambient temperatures of between 1.4 degrees and 24 degrees C, which minimizes heat loss across the pinnae and allows the surfaces of erect pinnae to approach ambient temperature. The pinnae are warmed by steady or pulsatile vasodilation in some animals when the ambient temperature is between 1 degree and 9 degrees C below body temperature, a response favoring heat loss. When ambient temperature exceeds body temperature by 4 degrees to 5 degrees C, the pinnae are circulated with blood cooler than ambient temperature; this response favors heat influx.",TRUE
Juvenile social dynamics reflect adult reproductive strategies in bottlenose dolphins,"The juvenile period is a challenging life-history stage, especially in species with a high degree of fission‚Äìfusion dynamics, such as bottlenose dolphins, where maternal protection is virtually absent. Here, we examined how juvenile male and female bottlenose dolphins navigate this vulnerable period. Specifically, we examined their grouping patterns, activity budget, network dynamics, and social associations in the absence of adults. We found that juveniles live in highly dynamic groups, with group composition changing every 10 min on average. Groups were generally segregated by sex, and segregation was driven by same-sex preference rather than opposite-sex avoidance. Juveniles formed strong associations with select individuals, especially kin and same-sex partners, and both sexes formed cliques with their preferred partners. Sex-specific strategies in the juvenile period reflected adult reproductive strategies, in which the exploration of potential social partners may be more important for males (which form long-term alliances in adulthood) than females (which preferentially associate with kin in adulthood). Females spent more time alone and were more focused on foraging than males, but still formed close same-sex associations, especially with kin. Males cast a wider social net than females, with strong same-sex associations and many male associates. Males engaged in more affiliative behavior than females. These results are consistent with the social bonds and skills hypothesis and suggest that delayed sexual maturity in species with relational social complexity may allow individuals to assess potential associates and explore a complex social landscape without the risks associated with sexual maturity (e.g., adult reproductive competition; inbreeding).",TRUE

K9 Water Searches: Scent and Scent Transport Considerations,"Abstract:‚ÄÇ Increased use of water search dogs for detecting submerged bodies has created the need for a better understanding of scent emanating from the bodies and how it transits the water to the dog‚Äôs nose. A review of recent literature identifies likely scent sources, potential scent transport processes, and research needs. Scent sources include gases in bubbles or dissolved in the water, liquids as buoyant plumes and droplets or dissolved in the water, and solids consisting of buoyant particulates with secretions, bacteria, and body fluids. Potential transport processes through the water include buoyancy, entrainment, and turbulence. Transport processes from the water surface into the air include volatilization and evaporation enhanced by bubble bursting, breaking waves, splashing, and wind spray. Implications for the use of water search dogs are examined. Observations of submerged, decomposing bodies are needed to quantify the physical and chemical characteristics of the scent and scent transport processes.",TRUE
Keeping cool: Enhanced optical reflection and radiative heat dissipation in Saharan silver ants,"Keeping cool Silver ants inhabit one of the hottest and driest environments on Earth, the Saharan sands, where most insects shrivel and die moments after contact. Shi et al. show that the triangular shape of the silver hairs that cover their bodies enables this existence. The hairs both increase the reflection of near-infrared rays and dissipate heat from the ants' bodies, even under full sun conditions. Evolution's simple solution to intense heat management in this species could lead to better designs for passive cooling of human-produced objects. Science, this issue p. 298 Silver hairs on Saharan ants facilitate both reflection and dissipation of intense heat. Saharan silver ants, Cataglyphis bombycina, forage under extreme temperature conditions in the African desert. We show that the ants‚Äô conspicuous silvery appearance is created by a dense array of triangular hairs with two thermoregulatory effects. They enhance not only the reflectivity of the ant‚Äôs body surface in the visible and near-infrared range of the spectrum, where solar radiation culminates, but also the emissivity of the ant in the mid-infrared. The latter effect enables the animals to efficiently dissipate heat back to the surroundings via blackbody radiation under full daylight conditions. This biological solution for a thermoregulatory problem may lead to the development of biomimetic coatings for passive radiative cooling of objects.",TRUE
"Kingfisher feathers ‚Äì colouration by pigments, spongy nanostructures and thin films","SUMMARY The colours of the common kingfisher, Alcedo atthis, reside in the barbs of the three main types of feather: the orange breast feathers, the cyan back feathers and the blue tail feathers. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the orange barbs contain small pigment granules. The cyan and blue barbs contain spongy nanostructures with slightly different dimensions, causing different reflectance spectra. Imaging scatterometry showed that the pigmented barbs create a diffuse orange scattering and the spongy barb structures create iridescence. The extent of the angle-dependent light scattering increases with decreasing wavelength. All barbs have a cortical envelope with a thickness of a few micrometres. The reflectance spectra of the cortex of the barbs show oscillations when measured from small areas, but when measured from larger areas the spectra become wavelength independent. This can be directly understood with thin film modelling, assuming a somewhat variable cortex thickness. The cortex reflectance appears to be small but not negligible with respect to the pigmentary and structural barb reflectance.",TRUE
Kinship influences social bonds among male southern Australian bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops cf. australis),"Male mammals employ a wide variety of mating strategies in order to increase their reproductive success, which in turn influence their social behavior. In some populations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.), males cooperate in small groups or alliances to gain access to females for mating. However, the occurrence of these male cooperative groups has been predicted to occur only under certain social and ecological conditions, driven by factors such as differences in population density, operational sex ratio, and sexual size dimorphism. Here, we used generalized affiliation indices, social network techniques, and maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers to investigate the affiliation patterns and genetic relatedness among male southern Australian bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops cf. australis) in a small embayment in South Australia. Photo-identification data and biopsy samples were collected in Coffin Bay from 2013 to 2015 through systematic boat-based surveys. We found that highly sighted male dolphins formed 12 social clusters composed of two to five individuals. Genetic analyses revealed that general male affiliation patterns were significantly correlated with mtDNA haplotype sharing. In addition, preferred affiliates showed significantly higher levels of genetic relatedness compared to casual and avoided male pairs. Our results corroborate theoretical expectations for the formation of social bonds in small delphinids and suggest that a high density of dolphins, with an expected skewed operational sex ratio and no apparent sexual size dimorphism, is likely to have favored the formation of strong male affiliations. In addition, the availability of genetic relatives within the population may have favored male affiliations based on kinship relationships.Significance statementMale bottlenose dolphins use different strategies to gain access to females, from single roving individuals, pairs or trios in alliances, to stable mixed-sex groups. Moreover, the role of kinship in the formation of male social bonds also varies within and among populations. This variability has been attributed to differences in ecological and intrinsic factors. Here, we studied the affiliation patterns and genetic relatedness in southern Australian bottlenose dolphins and demonstrated that kinship plays an important role in the formation of close male social ties. Furthermore, the results corroborate previous findings about the factors that contribute to the formation of male social bonds in these animals.",TRUE
Knickkopf protein protects and organizes chitin in the newly synthesized insect exoskeleton,"During each molting cycle of insect development, synthesis of new cuticle occurs concurrently with the partial degradation of the overlying old exoskeleton. Protection of the newly synthesized cuticle from molting fluid enzymes has long been attributed to the presence of an impermeable envelope layer that was thought to serve as a physical barrier, preventing molting fluid enzymes from accessing the new cuticle and thereby ensuring selective degradation of only the old one. In this study, using the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, as a model insect species, we show that an entirely different and unexpected mechanism accounts for the selective action of chitinases and possibly other molting enzymes. The molting fluid enzyme chitinase, which degrades the matrix polysaccharide chitin, is not excluded from the newly synthesized cuticle as previously assumed. Instead, the new cuticle is protected from chitinase action by the T. castaneum Knickkopf (TcKnk) protein. TcKnk colocalizes with chitin in the new cuticle and organizes it into laminae. Down-regulation of TcKnk results in chitinase-dependent loss of chitin, severe molting defects, and lethality at all developmental stages. The conservation of Knickkopf across insect, crustacean, and nematode taxa suggests that its critical roles in the laminar ordering and protection of exoskeletal chitin may be common to all chitinous invertebrates.",TRUE
Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14 inhibits Staphylococcus aureus infection of surgical implants in rats.,"Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of community and hospital-acquired infections. Moreover, the clinical impact of S. aureus is on the rise because of the global increase in the incidence of multidrug-resistant strains and its growing prevalence as a major cause of surgical infections. As a result, there is a pressing need to identify new antistaphylococcal agents and preventative strategies that will help in the management of these types of infections. This report describes the successful use of a probiotic, Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14, and its secreted biosurfactant to inhibit surgical implant infections caused by S. aureus. L. fermentum RC-14 and its secreted biosurfactant both significantly inhibited S. aureus infection and bacteria adherence to surgical implants.",TRUE
Life cycle of a cyanobacterial carboxysome,"Single cell and organelle measurements reveal activity dynamics and degradation of the carbon-fixing cyanobacterial carboxysome. Carboxysomes, prototypical bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) found in cyanobacteria, are large (~1 GDa) and essential protein complexes that enhance CO2 fixation. While carboxysome biogenesis has been elucidated, the activity dynamics, lifetime, and degradation of these structures have not been investigated, owing to the inability of tracking individual BMCs over time in vivo. We have developed a fluorescence-imaging platform to simultaneously measure carboxysome number, position, and activity over time in a growing cyanobacterial population, allowing individual carboxysomes to be clustered on the basis of activity and spatial dynamics. We have demonstrated both BMC degradation, characterized by abrupt activity loss followed by polar recruitment of the deactivated complex, and a subclass of ultraproductive carboxysomes. Together, our results reveal the BMC life cycle after biogenesis and describe the first method for measuring activity of single BMCs in vivo.",TRUE
Life under quartz: Hypolithic mosses in the Mojave Desert,"Several species of dryland cyanobacteria are known to occur as hypoliths under semi-translucent rocks. In the Mojave Desert, these organisms find refuge from intense solar radiation under milky quartz where moisture persists for a longer period of time than in adjacent soil surface habitat. Desert mosses, which are extremely desiccation-tolerant, can also occur in these hypolithic spaces, though little is known about this unique moss microhabitat and how species composition compares to that of adjacent soil surface communities. To address this question, we deployed microclimate dataloggers and collected moss samples from under and adjacent to 18 milky quartz rocks (quartz mean center thickness 26 ¬± 15 mm) in a western high elevation Mojave Desert site. Light transmission through Mojave quartz rocks may be as low as 1.2%, and data from microclimate loggers deployed for five months support the hypothesis that quartz provides thermal buffering and higher relative humidity compared to the soil surface. Of the 53 samples collected from hypolith and surface microhabitats, 68% were Syntrichia caninervis, the dominant bryophyte of the Mojave Desert biological soil crust. Tortula inermis accounted for 28% of the samples and 4% were Bryum argenteum. In a comparison of moss community composition, we found that S. caninervis was more likely to be on the soil surface, though it was abundant in both microhabitats, while T. inermis was more restricted to hypoliths, perhaps due to protection from temperature extremes. In our study site, the differences between hypolithic and surface microhabitats enable niche partitioning between T. inermis and S. caninervis, enhancing alpha diversity. This work points to the need to thoroughly consider microhabitats when assessing bryophyte species diversity and modelling species distributions. This focus is particularly important in extreme environments, where mosses may find refuge from the prevailing macroclimatic conditions in microhabitats such as hypoliths.",TRUE
Light inside sponges,"Sponges are the most basal metazoan organisms. As sessile filter feeders in marine or freshwater habitats, they often live in close association with phototrophic microorganisms. Active photosynthesis by the associated microorganisms has been believed to be restricted to the outer tissue portion of the sponge hosts. However, phototrophic microorganisms have also been detected in deeper tissue regions. In many cases they are found around spicules, siliceous skelettal elements of demosponges and hexactinellids. The finding of phototrophic organisms seemingly assembled around spicules led to the hypothesis of a siliceous light transmission system in sponges. The principle ability to conduct light was already shown for sponge derived, explanted spicules. However it was not shown until now, that in deed sponges have a light transmission system, and can harbour photosynthetically active microorganisms in deeper tissue regions.  Here we show for the first time, that, as hypothesized 13 year ago, sponge spicules in living specimens transmit light into deeper tissue regions. Our results demonstrate that in opposite to the actual opinion, photosynthetically active microorganisms can also live in deeper tissue regions, and not only directly beneath the surface, when a light transmission system (spicules) is present.  Our results show the possibility of massive or globular sponges being supplied with photosynthetic products or pathways throughout their whole body, implying not only a more important role of these endobioses. Our findings also elucidate the in-situ function of a recently more and more interesting biomaterial, which is unique not only for its mechanical, electrical and optical properties. Biosilica is of special interest for the possibility to produce it enzymatically under environmental conditions.",TRUE
Light-powered CO2 fixation in a chloroplast mimic with natural and synthetic parts,"Hybrid approach catches light Plant chloroplasts enclose two major photosynthetic processes: light reactions, which generate the energy carriers adenosine triphosphate and reduced nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), and dark reactions, which use these molecules to fix carbon dioxide and build biomass. Miller et al. appropriated natural components, thylakoid membranes from spinach, for the light reactions and showed that these could be coupled to a synthetic enzymatic cycle that fixes carbon dioxide within water-in-oil droplets. The composition of the droplets could be tuned and optimized and the metabolic activity monitored in real time by NADPH fluorescence (see the Perspective by Gaut and Adamala). These chloroplast-mimicking droplets bring together natural and synthetic components in a small space and are amenable to further functionalization to perform complex biosynthetic tasks. Science, this issue p. 649; see also p. 587 Natural photosynthetic components power a synthetic CO2 fixation pathway in picoliter droplets. Nature integrates complex biosynthetic and energy-converting tasks within compartments such as chloroplasts and mitochondria. Chloroplasts convert light into chemical energy, driving carbon dioxide fixation. We used microfluidics to develop a chloroplast mimic by encapsulating and operating photosynthetic membranes in cell-sized droplets. These droplets can be energized by light to power enzymes or enzyme cascades and analyzed for their catalytic properties in multiplex and real time. We demonstrate how these microdroplets can be programmed and controlled by adjusting internal compositions and by using light as an external trigger. We showcase the capability of our platform by integrating the crotonyl‚Äìcoenzyme A (CoA)/ethylmalonyl-CoA/hydroxybutyryl-CoA (CETCH) cycle, a synthetic network for carbon dioxide conversion, to create an artificial photosynthetic system that interfaces the natural and the synthetic biological worlds.",TRUE
Linkage Biomechanics and Evolution of the Unique Feeding Mechanism of Epibulus Insidiator (Labridae: Teleostei),Epibulus insidiator (Pallas) possesses the most extreme jaw protrusion ever measured in fishes. Biomechanical models of the mechanisms of jaw protrusion and hyoid depression in Epibulus are proposed and tested. The models are designed using principles of four-bar linkages from engineering theory. The models calculate the geometry of the feeding mechanisms from morphometric data on cranial anatomy. Predictions made from the models about the feeding kinematics of Epibulus are tested by comparison with kinematic data. The model of the jaw mechanism is accurate in predicting the unique feeding mechanics of the jaws of Epibulus for most relationships between kinematic variables. A model of simultaneous cranial elevation and sternohyoideus muscle contraction is accurate in predicting hyoid depression during feeding. Biomechanical considerations limit the number of possible pathways of evolution of the jaw mechanism of Epibulus from that of its closest labrid relatives.,TRUE
Lipids of the Stratum Corneum Vary with Cutaneous Water Loss among Larks along a Temperature‚ÄêMoisture Gradient,"We explored the relationship between lipids of the stratum corneum (SC), the barrier to water‚Äêvapor diffusion of the skin, and cutaneous water loss (CWL) of species of free‚Äêliving larks along a temperature‚Äêmoisture gradient. Our results showed that free fatty acids, cholesterol, and ceramides were the major constituents of SC in larks from different environments including the Netherlands, a mesic environment; Iran, a semiarid region; and several areas in Saudi Arabia, a hot dry desert. We found that CWL was reduced among larks inhabiting deserts, but our data did not support the hypothesis that birds from desert environments have larger quantities of lipids per unit dry mass of the SC than larks from more mesic environments. Instead, larks in arid environments had a higher proportion of ceramides, especially the more polar fractions 4‚Äì6, and a smaller proportion of free fatty acids in their SC, an adjustment that apparently reduced their CWL. Subtle changes in the ratios of lipid classes can apparently alter the movement of water vapor through the skin. We hypothesize that desert birds have higher proportions of ceramides in their SC and lower proportions of free fatty acids because this combination allows the lipid lamellae to exist in a more highly ordered crystalline phase and consequently creates a tighter barrier to water‚Äêvapor diffusion.",TRUE
Liquid‚Äìliquid phase separation morphologies in ultra-white beetle scales and a synthetic equivalent,"Cyphochilus beetle scales are amongst the brightest structural whites in nature, being highly opacifying whilst extremely thin. However, the formation mechanism for the voided intra-scale structure is unknown. Here we report 3D x-ray nanotomography data for the voided chitin networks of intact white scales of Cyphochilus and Lepidiota stigma. Chitin-filling fractions are found to be 31‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ2% for Cyphochilus and 34‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1% for Lepidiota stigma, indicating previous measurements overestimated their density. Optical simulations using finite-difference time domain for the chitin morphologies and simulated Cahn-Hilliard spinodal structures show excellent agreement. Reflectance curves spanning filling fraction of 5-95% for simulated spinodal structures, pinpoint optimal whiteness for 25% chitin filling. We make a simulacrum from a polymer undergoing a strong solvent quench, resulting in highly reflective (~94%) white films. In-situ X-ray scattering confirms the nanostructure is formed through spinodal decomposition phase separation. We conclude that the ultra-white beetle scale nanostructure is made via liquid‚Äìliquid phase separation.White beetle scales strongly scatter white light, whilst being very thin. Here, the authors measured the internal scale nanostructure for the beetles, Cyphochilus and L. stigma, and demonstrate that the optical structure can be simulated using liquid‚Äìliquid phase separation nanostructures, pointing to this as the formation mechanism.",TRUE
Lobster Sniffing: Antennule Design and Hydrodynamic Filtering of Information in an Odor Plume,"The first step in processing olfactory information, before neural filtering, is the physical capture of odor molecules from the surrounding fluid. Many animals capture odors from turbulent water currents or wind using antennae that bear chemosensory hairs. We used planar laser‚Äìinduced fluorescence to reveal how lobster olfactory antennules hydrodynamically alter the spatiotemporal patterns of concentration in turbulent odor plumes. As antennules flick, water penetrates their chemosensory hair array during the fast downstroke, carrying fine-scale patterns of concentration into the receptor area. This spatial pattern, blurred by flow along the antennule during the downstroke, is retained during the slower return stroke and is not shed until the next flick.",TRUE
Localized fluidization burrowing mechanics of Ensis directus,"SUMMARY Muscle measurements of Ensis directus, the Atlantic razor clam, indicate that the organism only has sufficient strength to burrow a few centimeters into the soil, yet razor clams burrow to over 70 cm. In this paper, we show that the animal uses the motions of its valves to locally fluidize the surrounding soil and reduce burrowing drag. Substrate deformations were measured using particle image velocimetry (PIV) in a novel visualization system that enabled us to see through the soil and watch E. directus burrow in situ. PIV data, supported by soil and fluid mechanics theory, show that contraction of the valves of E. directus locally fluidizes the surrounding soil. Particle and fluid mixtures can be modeled as a Newtonian fluid with an effective viscosity based on the local void fraction. Using these models, we demonstrate that E. directus is strong enough to reach full burrow depth in fluidized soil, but not in static soil. Furthermore, we show that the method of localized fluidization reduces the amount of energy required to reach burrow depth by an order of magnitude compared with penetrating static soil, and leads to a burrowing energy that scales linearly with depth rather than with depth squared.",TRUE
LOCOMOTOR PERFORMANCE AND ENERGETIC COST OF SIDEWINDING BY THE SNAKE CROTALUS CERASTES,"We measured the performance (burst speed and endurance) and the energetic cost of sidewinding locomotion for the viperid snake Crotalus cerastes. The linear scaling regressions relating log mass to log burst speed and log endurance have slopes of 0.29 and 1.01, respectively. Maximal burst speed observed for an individual snake (SVL=41.9cm, SVL is snout-vent length) was3.7kmh‚àí1. Adult snakes were able to match a tread speed of 0.5 km h‚àí1 for times ranging from 33 to more than 180 min, and at 0.7kmh‚àí1 endurance times ranged from 9 to 52 min. Rates of oxygen consumption increased linearly over a range of aerobically sustainable speeds (0.28‚Äì0.50kmh‚àí1), with a resulting net cost of transport (NCT) of 0.408mlO2g‚àí1km‚àí1 for eight snakes with a mean mass of 110g. Sidewinding of C.cerastes involves periodic movements with a frequency that increases linearly with mean forward speed. At 0.50 km h‚àí1, the mean (N=8) mass-specific energetic cost per cycle of movement was 0.28 JulO2g‚àí1 cycle‚àí1 for sidewinding. The NCT and the cost per cycle of movement of C. cerastes sidewinding are significantly less than those of similar mass snakes (Coluber constrictor) performing either terrestrial lateral undulation or concertina locomotion. The NCT of C. cerastes sidewinding is also significantly less than that predicted for the terrestrial limbed locomotion of lizards of similar mass. Mean VOO2max of C. cerastes (0.405 ml O2g‚àí1h‚àí1) is only about half that reported for C. constrictor; however, the mean endurance at 0.60 km h‚àí1 (73 min) for sidewinding C. cerastes does not differ significantly from that reported for C. constrictor laterally undulating.",TRUE
Long-distance transport of gases in plants: a perspective on internal aeration and radial oxygen loss from roots,"Internal transport of gases is crucial for vascular plants inhabiting aquatic, wetland or flood-prone environments. Diffusivity of gases in water is approximately 10¬†000 times slower than in air; thus direct exchange of gases between submerged tissues and the environment is strongly impeded. Aerenchyma provides a low-resistance internal pathway for gas transport between shoot and root extremities. By this pathway, O2 is supplied to the roots and rhizosphere, while CO2, ethylene, and methane move from the soil to the shoots and atmosphere. Diffusion is the mechanism by which gases move within roots of all plant species, but significant pressurized through-flow occurs in stems and rhizomes of several emergent and floating-leaved wetland plants. Through-flows can raise O2 concentrations in the rhizomes close to ambient levels. In general, rates of flow are determined by plant characteristics such as capacity to generate positive pressures in shoot tissues, and resistance to flow in the aerenchyma, as well as environmental conditions affecting leaf-to-air gradients in humidity and temperature. O2 diffusion in roots is influenced by anatomical, morphological and physiological characteristics, and environmental conditions. Roots of many (but not all) wetland species contain large volumes of aerenchyma (e.g. root porosity can reach 55%), while a barrier impermeable to radial O2 loss (ROL) often occurs in basal zones. These traits act synergistically to enhance the amount of O2 diffusing to the root apex and enable the development of an aerobic rhizosphere around the root tip, which enhances root penetration into anaerobic substrates. The barrier to ROL in roots of some species is induced by growth in stagnant conditions, whereas it is constitutive in others. An inducible change in the resistance to O2 across the hypodermis/exodermis is hypothesized to be of adaptive significance to plants inhabiting transiently waterlogged soils. Knowledge on the anatomical basis of the barrier to ROL in various species is scant. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that the barrier may also impede influx of: (i) soil-derived gases, such as CO2, methane, and ethylene; (ii) potentially toxic substances (e.g. reduced metal ions) often present in waterlogged soils; and (iii) nutrients and water. Lateral roots, that remain permeable to O2, may be the main surface for exchange of substances between the roots and rhizosphere in wetland species. Further work is required to determine whether diversity in structure and function in roots of wetland species can be related to various niche habitats.",TRUE
Longer-lived tropical songbirds reduce breeding activity as they buffer impacts of drought,"Droughts are expected to increase in frequency and severity with climate change. Population impacts of such harsh environmental events are theorized to vary with life history strategies among species. However, existing demographic models generally do not consider behavioural plasticity that may modify the impact of harsh events. Here we show that tropical songbirds in the New and Old Worlds reduced reproduction during drought, with greater reductions in species with higher average long-term survival. Large reductions in reproduction by longer-lived species were associated with higher survival during drought than predrought years in Malaysia, whereas shorter-lived species maintained reproduction and survival decreased. Behavioural strategies of longer-lived, but not shorter-lived, species mitigated the effect of increasing drought frequency on long-term population growth. Behavioural plasticity can buffer the impact of climate change on populations of some species and differences in plasticity among species related to their life histories are critical for predicting population trajectories. Climate change impacts on population dynamics will depend on species‚Äô life history strategies. In contrast to short-lived species, longer-lived tropical songbirds reduced reproduction during drought, leading to higher survival and mitigating the effect on long-term population growth.",TRUE
Loss of top-down biotic interactions changes the relative benefits for obligate mutualists,"The collapse of mutualisms owing to anthropogenic changes is contributing to losses of biodiversity. Top predators can regulate biotic interactions between species at lower trophic levels and may contribute to the stability of such mutualisms, but they are particularly likely to be lost after disturbance of communities. We focused on the mutualism between the fig tree Ficus microcarpa and its host-specific pollinator fig wasp and compared the benefits accrued by the mutualists in natural and translocated areas of distribution. Parasitoids of the pollinator were rare or absent outside the natural range of the mutualists, where the relative benefits the mutualists gained from their interaction were changed significantly away from the plant's natural range owing to reduced seed production rather than increased numbers of pollinator offspring. Furthermore, in the absence of the negative effects of its parasitoids, we detected an oviposition range expansion by the pollinator, with the use of a wider range of ovules that could otherwise have generated seeds. Loss of top-down control has therefore resulted in a change in the balance of reciprocal benefits that underpins this obligate mutualism, emphasizing the value of maintaining food web complexity in the Anthropocene.",TRUE
Lung ventilation in salamanders and the evolution of vertebrate air-breathing mechanisms,"Abstract Functional analysis of lung ventilation in salamanders combined with historical analysis of respiratory pumps provides new perspectives on the evolution of breathing mechanisms in vertebrates. Lung ventilation in the aquatic salamander Necturus maculosus was examined by means of cineradiography, measurement of buccal and pleuroperitoneal cavity pressures, and electromyography of hypaxial musculature. In deoxygenated water Necturus periodically rises to the surface, opens its mouth, expands its buccal cavity to draw in fresh air, exhales air from the lungs, closes its mouth, and then compresses its buccal cavity and pumps air into the lungs. Thus Necturus produces only two buccal movements per breath: one expansion and one compression. Necturus shares the use of this two-stroke buccal pump with lungfishes, frogs and other salamanders. The ubiquitous use of this system by basal sarcopterygians is evidence that a two-stroke buccal pump is the primitive lung ventilation mechanism for sarcopterygian vertebrates. In contrast, basal actinopterygian fishes use a four-stroke buccal pump. In these fishes the buccal cavity expands to fill with expired air, compresses to expel the pulmonary air, expands to fill with fresh air, and then compresses for a second time to pump air into the lungs. Whether the sarcopterygian two-stroke buccal pump and the actinopterygian four-stroke buccal pump arose independently, whether both are derived from a single, primitive osteichthyian breathing mechanism, or whether one might be the primitive pattern and the other derived, cannot be determined Although Necturus and lungfishes both use a two-stroke buccal pump, they differ in their expiration mechanics. Unlike a lungfish (Protopterus), Necturus exhales by contracting a portion of its hypaxial trunk musculature (the m. transversus abdominis) to increase pleuroperitoneal pressure. The occurrence of this same expiratory mechanism in amniotes is evidence that the use of hypaxial musculature for expiration, but not for inspiration, is a primitive tetrapod feature. From this observation we hypothesize that aspiration breathing may have evolved in two stages: initially, from pure buccal pumping to the use of trunk musculature for exhalation but not for inspiration (as in Necturus); and secondarily, to the use of trunk musculature for both exhalation and inhalation by costal aspiration (as in amniotes).",TRUE
Lymphatic collecting vessel maturation and valve morphogenesis.,"The lymphatic vasculature plays an essential role in the maintenance of tissue interstitial fluid balance and in the immune response. After capture of fluids, proteins and antigens by lymphatic capillaries, lymphatic collecting vessels ensure lymph transport. An important component to avoid lymph backflow and to allow a unidirectional flow is the presence of intraluminal valves. Defects in the function of collecting vessels lead to lymphedema. Several important factors and signaling pathways involved in lymphatic collecting vessel maturation and valve morphogenesis have now been discovered. The present review summarizes the current knowledge about the key steps of lymphatic collecting vessel development and maturation and focuses on the regulatory mechanisms involved in lymphatic valve formation.",TRUE
Macroevolutionary assembly of ant/plant symbioses: Pseudomyrmex ants and their ant-housing plants in the Neotropics,"Symbioses include some of the clearest cases of coevolution, but their origin, loss or reassembly with different partners can rarely be inferred. Here we use ant/plant symbioses involving three plant clades to investigate the evolution of symbioses. We generated phylogenies for the big-eyed arboreal ants (Pseudomyrmecinae), including 72% of their 286 species, as well as for five of their plant host groups, in each case sampling more than 61% of the species. We show that the ant-housing Vachellia (Mimosoideae) clade and its ants co-diversified for the past 5 Ma, with some species additionally colonized by younger plant-nesting ant species, some parasitic. An apparent co-radiation of ants and Tachigali (Caesalpinioideae) was followed by waves of colonization by the same ant clade, and subsequent occupation by a younger ant group. Wide crown and stem age differences between the ant-housing genus Triplaris (Polygonaceae) and its obligate ant inhabitants, and stochastic trait mapping, indicate that its domatium evolved earlier than the ants now occupying it, suggesting previous symbioses that dissolved. Parasitic ant species evolved from generalists, not from mutualists, and are younger than the mutualistic systems they parasitize. Our study illuminates the macroevolutionary assembly of ant/plant symbioses, which has been highly dynamic, even in very specialized systems.",TRUE
Macrophages employ quorum licensing to regulate collective activation,"Macrophage-initiated inflammation is tightly regulated to eliminate threats such as infections while suppressing harmful immune activation. However, individual cells‚Äô signaling responses to pro-inflammatory cues are heterogeneous, with subpopulations emerging with high or low activation states. Here, we use single-cell tracking and dynamical modeling to develop and validate a revised model for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophage activation that invokes a mechanism we term quorum licensing. The results show that bimodal phenotypic partitioning of macrophages is primed during the resting state, dependent on cumulative history of cell density, predicted by extrinsic noise in transcription factor expression, and independent of canonical LPS-induced intercellular feedback in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) response. Our analysis shows how this density-dependent coupling produces a nonlinear effect on collective TNF production. We speculate that by linking macrophage density to activation, this mechanism could amplify local responses to threats and prevent false alarms. Macrophage activation is tightly regulated to maintain immune homeostasis, yet activation is also heterogeneous. Here, the authors show that macrophages coordinate activation by partitioning into two phenotypes that can¬†nonlinearly amplify collective inflammatory cytokine production as a function of cell density.",TRUE
Magnetoreception System in Honeybees (Apis mellifera),"Honeybees (Apis mellifera) undergo iron biomineralization, providing the basis for magnetoreception. We showed earlier the presence of superparamagnetic magnetite in iron granules formed in honeybees, and subscribed to the notion that external magnetic fields may cause expansion or contraction of the superparamagnetic particles in an orientation-specific manner, relaying the signal via cytoskeleton (Hsu and Li 1994). In this study, we established a size-density purification procedure, with which quantitative amount of iron granules was obtained from honey bee trophocytes and characterized; the density of iron granules was determined to be 1.25 g/cm3. While we confirmed the presence of superparamagnetic magnetite in the iron granules, we observed changes in the size of the magnetic granules in the trophycytes upon applying additional magnetic field to the cells. A concomitant release of calcium ion was observed by confocal microscope. This size fluctuation triggered the increase of intracellular Ca+2 , which was inhibited by colchicines and latrunculin B, known to be blockers for microtubule and microfilament syntheses, respectively. The associated cytoskeleton may thus relay the magnetosignal, initiating a neural response. A model for the mechanism of magnetoreception in honeybees is proposed, which may be applicable to most, if not all, magnetotactic organisms.",TRUE
Magnetosome formation in prokaryotes,"Magnetotactic bacteria were discovered almost 30 years ago, and for many years and many different reasons, the number of researchers working in this field was few and progress was slow. Recently, however, thanks to the isolation of new strains and the development of new techniques for manipulating these strains, researchers from several laboratories have made significant progress in elucidating the molecular, biochemical, chemical and genetic bases of magnetosome formation and understanding how these unique intracellular organelles function. We focus here on this progress.",TRUE
"Male Eufriesia purpurata, a DDT-collecting euglossine bee in Brazil","While studying the ecology of the malaria vector Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) darlingi Root along the Ituxi River, Amazonas, Brazil, we observed aggregates of bees on the walls of houses that were routinely sprayed with DDT. Several bees collected from DDT-treated house walls in August 1978 were identified as male specimens of Eufriesia purpurata (Moscary) of the tribe Euglossini (Hymenoptera: Apoidae). (The bees were identified as Euplusia purpurata by Anthony Raw, Laboratorio de Ecologia, Universidade de Brasilia. The change of generic name from Euplusia to Eufriesia is based on ref. 1.) These bees were well known to the local residents as the insects that eat DDT and we present here the first documentation that they (1) are attracted to DDT, (2) actively collect large quantities of DDT from treated house walls and (3) suffer no apparent insecticidal effects. We also found that the frequency of house visiting is most intense during July to September. Most bees arrive at houses before 12.00 h, remain 2‚Äì3 h and return on subsequent days to collect more DDT. Noise produced by bees as they collected DDT was a notable disturbance to 76% of 21 families interviewed along the Ituxi River.",TRUE
Manipulation of a spider peptide toxin alters its affinity for lipid bilayers and potency and selectivity for voltage-gated sodium channel subtype 1.7,"Huwentoxin-IV (HwTx-IV) is a gating modifier peptide toxin from spiders that has weak affinity for the lipid bilayer. As some gating modifier toxins have affinity for model lipid bilayers, a tripartite relationship among gating modifier toxins, voltage-gated ion channels, and the lipid membrane surrounding the channels has been proposed. We previously designed an HwTx-IV analogue (gHwTx-IV) with reduced negative charge and increased hydrophobic surface profile, which displays increased lipid bilayer affinity and in vitro activity at the voltage-gated sodium channel subtype 1.7 (NaV1.7), a channel targeted in pain management. Here, we show that replacements of the positively-charged residues that contribute to the activity of the peptide can improve gHwTx-IV's potency and selectivity for NaV1.7. Using HwTx-IV, gHwTx-IV, [R26A]gHwTx-IV, [K27A]gHwTx-IV, and [R29A]gHwTx-IV variants, we examined their potency and selectivity at human NaV1.7 and their affinity for the lipid bilayer. [R26A]gHwTx-IV consistently displayed the most improved potency and selectivity for NaV1.7, examined alongside off-target NaVs, compared with HwTx-IV and gHwTx-IV. The lipid affinity of each of the three novel analogues was weaker than that of gHwTx-IV, but stronger than that of HwTx-IV, suggesting a possible relationship between in vitro potency at NaV1.7 and affinity for lipid bilayers. In a murine NaV1.7 engagement model, [R26A]gHwTx-IV exhibited an efficacy comparable with that of native HwTx-IV. In summary, this study reports the development of an HwTx-IV analogue with improved in vitro selectivity for the pain target NaV1.7 and with an in vivo efficacy similar to that of native HwTx-IV.",TRUE
"Material properties of the skin of the Kenyan sand boa Gongylophis colubrinus (Squamata, Boidae)","On the basis of structural data, it has been previously assumed that the integument of snakes consists of a hard, robust, inflexible outer surface (Oberh√§utchen and Œ≤-layer) and soft, flexible inner layers (Œ±-layers). The aim of this study was to compare material properties of the outer and inner scale layers of the exuvium of Gongylophis colubrinus, to relate the structure of the snake integument to its mechanical properties. The nanoindentation experiments have demonstrated that the outer scale layers are harder, and have a higher effective elastic modulus than the inner scale layers. The results obtained provide strong evidence about the presence of a gradient in the material properties of the snake integument. The possible functional significance of this gradient is discussed here as a feature minimizing damage to the integument during sliding locomotion on an abrasive surface, such as sand.",TRUE
Mechanical design in arteries,"The most important mechanical property of the artery wall is its non-linear elasticity. Over the last century, this has been well-documented in vessels in many animals, from humans to lobsters. Arteries must be distensible to provide capacitance and pulse-smoothing in the circulation, but they must also be stable to inflation over a range of pressure. These mechanical requirements are met by strain-dependent increases in the elastic modulus of the vascular wall, manifest by a J-shaped stress-strain curve, as typically exhibited by other soft biological tissues. All vertebrates and invertebrates with closed circulatory systems have arteries with this non-linear behaviour, but specific tissue properties vary to give correct function for the physiological pressure range of each species. In all cases, the non-linear elasticity is a product of the parallel arrangement of rubbery and stiff connective tissue elements in the artery wall, and differences in composition and tissue architecture can account for the observed variations in mechanical properties. This phenomenon is most pronounced in large whales, in which very high compliance in the aortic arch and exceptionally low compliance in the descending aorta occur, and is correlated with specific modifications in the arterial structure.",TRUE
Mechanical Design in Sea Anemones,"By applying principles of fluid and solid mechanics to biological structures, I have studied the morphological adaptations of two species of sea anemones to the mechanical activities they perform and the environmental forces they encounter. The two species of anemones I used represent different extremes in mechanical behavior: Metridium senile, a calm-water species noted for the great range of shapes and sizes it can assume (Batham and Pantin, 1950), and Anthopleura xanthogrammica, a species occurring in areas exposed to extreme wave action (Hand, 1956; Dayton, 1971). I chose anemones because they are simple in structure, thus differences in morphology and function between species are easier to recognize and characterize than they would be for more complex animals.",TRUE
Mechanical design of mussel byssus: material yield enhances attachment strength,"The competitive dominance of mussels in the wave-swept rocky intertidal zone is in part due to their ability to maintain a secure attachment. Mussels are tethered to the substratum by a byssus composed of numerous extracellular, collagenous threads secreted by the foot. Each byssal thread has three serially arranged parts: a corrugated proximal region, a smooth distal region and an adhesive plaque. This study examines the material and structural properties of the byssal threads of three mussel species: Mytilus californianus, M. trossulus, and M. galloprovincialis. Tensile tests in general reveal similar material properties among species: the proximal region has a lower initial modulus, a lower ultimate stress and a higher ultimate strain than the distal region. The distal region also yields at a stress well below its ultimate value. In whole thread tests, the proximal region and adhesive plaque are common sites of structural failure and are closely matched in strength, while the distal region appears to be excessively strong. We propose that the high strength of the distal region is the byproduct of a material designed to yield and extend before structural failure occurs. Experimental and theoretical evidence is presented suggesting that thread yield and extensibility provide two important mechanisms for increasing the overall attachment strength of the mussel: (1) the reorientation of threads towards the direction of applied load, and (2) the 'recruitment' of more threads into tension and the consequent distribution of applied load over a larger cross-sectional area, thereby reducing the stress on each thread. This distal region yield behavior is most striking for M. californianus and may be a key to its success in extreme wave-swept environments.",TRUE
Mechanical evidence that flamingos can support their body on one leg with little active muscular force,"Flamingos (Phoenicopteridae) often stand and sleep on one leg for long periods, but it is unknown how much active muscle contractile force they use for the mechanical demands of standing on one leg: body weight support and maintaining balance. First, we demonstrated that flamingo cadavers could passively support body weight on one leg without any muscle activity while adopting a stable, unchanging, joint posture resembling that seen in live flamingos. By contrast, the cadaveric flamingo could not be stably held in a two-legged pose, suggesting a greater necessity for active muscle force to stabilize two-legged versus one-legged postures. Our results suggest that flamingos engage a passively engaged gravitational stay apparatus (proximally located) for weight support during one-legged standing. Second, we discovered that live flamingos standing on one leg have markedly reduced body sway during quiescent versus alert behaviours, with the point of force application directly under the distal joint, reducing the need for muscular joint torque. Taken together, our results highlight the possibility that flamingos stand for long durations on one leg without exacting high muscular forces and, thus, with little energetic expenditure.",TRUE

Mechanical Organization of Cantileverlike Sessile Organisms: Sea Anemones,"Engineering beam theory has been used to analyse the ways in which body shape and elastic modulus of two species of sea anemones affect their mechanical responses to flow. 1.Anthopleura xanthogrammica is exposed to wave action, but because it is short, wide, and thick-walled, maximum tensile stresses in its body walls due to flow forces are an order of magnitude lower than those in the tall, slim, thin-walled, calm-water sea anemone Metridium senile.2. The elastic modulus of M. senile body wall is more dependent on extension rate than is that of A. xanthogrammica. Because the extension rate of M. senile body wall in tidal currents is higher than that of A. xanthogrammica in wave surge, the moduli of walls from these species when exposed to such flow conditions are similar, between 0.1 and 0.3 MN.m‚àí2.3.

"Mechanical properties and structure of Strombus gigas, Tridacna gigas, and Haliotis rufescens sea shells: A comparative study","Sea shells are composed of calcium carbonate crystals interleaved with layers of viscoelastic proteins, having dense, tailored structures that yield excellent mechanical properties. Shells such as conch (Strombus gigas), giant clam (Tridacna gigas), and red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) have hierarchical architectures that differ depending on growth requirements and shell formation of the particular mollusk. Mechanical tests have been carried out on these shells for a comparison of strength with respect to the microstructural architecture and sample orientation. The mechanical response is found to vary significantly from specimen to specimen and requires the application of Weibull statistics in order to be quantitatively evaluated. The complex micro-laminate structure of these biocomposite materials is characterized and related to their mechanical properties. The red abalone has the highest compressive (233‚Äì540 MPa) and flexure strengths of the three shells. The giant clam has the lowest strength (87‚Äì123 MPa) and the conch has an intermediate value (166‚Äì218 MPa) in compression. The high compressive strength observed in the abalone is attributed to an optimization of microstructural architecture in the form of 2-D laminates, enhancing the fracture toughness of this shell material and enabling higher stresses to develop before fracture.

Mechanics of cutting maneuvers by ostriches (Struthio camelus),"SUMMARY We studied the strategies used by cursorial bipeds (ostriches) to maneuver during running. Eight ostriches were induced to run along a trackway and execute turns. Ground reaction forces and three-dimensional kinematics of the body and leg joints were simultaneously recorded, allowing calculation of joint angles and quasi-static net joint torques. Sidesteps, where the leg on the outside of the turn changes the movement direction, and crossovers using the inside leg, occurred with nearly equal frequency. Ostriches executed maneuvers using a simple control strategy that required minimal changes to leg kinematics or net torque production at individual joints. Although ostriches did use acceleration or braking forces to control body rotation, their morphology allowed for both crossovers and sidesteps to be accomplished with minimal net acceleratory/braking force production. Moreover, body roll and ab/adduction of the leg shifted the foot position away from the turn direction, reducing the acceleratory/braking forces required to prevent under- or over-rotation and aligning the leg with the ground reaction force.",TRUE
"Mechanics of Jet Propulsion in the Hydromedusan Jellyfish, Polyorchis Pexicillatus: I. Mechanical Properties of the Locomotor Structure","A non-destructive test was developed to measure the static mechanical properties of the locomotor structure (bell) in the hydromedusan jellyfish, Polyorchis penicillatus (Eschscholtz, 1829). A nonlinear stress-strain relationship was found, and the mean static structural stiffness of the bell was 150 N m‚àí2. Visualization procedures that showed the natural changes in the geometry of the deformation of the bell were used to calculate the static modulus of elasticity of the mesoglea, and gave a modulus of 400 N m‚àí2. Dynamic measurements on isolated samples of mesoglea gave a mean storage modulus of 1000 N m‚àí2. The resilience of the material was about 58%. These data were integrated to imply that the dynamic structural stiffness of the bell is at least 400 N m‚àí2. Attempts to measure the dynamic structural stiffness directly indicate that the dynamic stiffness of the intact bell lies between 400 and 1000 N m‚àí2. All, or most, of the potential energy stored in the mesoglea during contractions of the bell is stored as strain energy in the radial mesogleal fibres.",TRUE
Mechanics without Muscle: Biomechanical Inspiration from the Plant World,"Plant and animal biomechanists have much in common. Although their frame of reference differs, they think about the natural world in similar ways. While researchers studying animals might explore airflow around flapping wings, the actuation of muscles in arms and legs, or the material properties of spider silk, researchers studying plants might explore the flow of water around fluttering seaweeds, the grasping ability of climbing vines, or the material properties of wood. Here we summarize recent studies of plant biomechanics highlighting several current research themes in the field: expulsion of high-speed reproductive projectiles, generation of slow movements by shrinking and swelling cell walls, effects of ontogenetic shifts in mechanical properties of stems, flexible reconfiguration and material properties of seaweeds under crashing waves, and the development of botanically-inspired commercial products. Our hope is that this synopsis will resonate with both plant and animal biologists, encourage cross-pollination across disciplines, and promote fruitful interdisciplinary collaborations in the future.",TRUE
Mechanism of Closure of the Aortic Valve,"THE human aortic valve consists of three cusps made of relatively inelastic, muscle-free material about 0.15 mm thick. It opens and shuts about once a second, and withstands a pressure difference of 100 mm of mercury when closed. It usually functions for 70 yr without failure, and works so efficiently that very little blood is regurgitated at each pulse. In order to support this large pressure difference, the cusps must close simultaneously in all operating conditions and should not touch the wall of the aorta, for considerable reversed flow would then be required to close the valve. This action suggests a fluid dynamic control mechanism which positions the cusps away from the wall of the aorta, so that the slightest reversed flow will close the valve.",TRUE
Mechanism of infrared detection and transduction by beetle Melanophila Acuminata,"The Melanophila acuminata beetle is attracted to forest fires via a pair of infrared sensory organs composed of sensilla. Our histological work showed that each sensillum contains lipid layers surrounding a protein layer and a unique polysaccharide base that is associated with a neuron to each sensillum. Infrared microscopy showed that the protein region maximally absorbs infrared radiation at 3 Œºm wavelength and at 10 Œºm, which corresponds to the known radiation produced by forest fires at 3 Œºm. Mathematical calculations showed that the physical properties of the sensilla are such that the expected temperature rise is insufficient for transduction of the infrared signal through mechanical means or as a thermal receptor as previously thought; hence the protein plays the pivotal role in perception of single photons and transmission of the signal within the sensilla.",TRUE
Mechanisms and consequences of flight polyphenisms in an outbreaking bark beetle species,"ABSTRACT Flight polyphenisms naturally occur as discrete or continuous traits in insects. Discrete flight polyphenisms include winged and wingless morphs, whereas continuous flight polyphenisms can take the form of short- or long-distance fliers. The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) exhibits polyphenic variation in flight distance but the consequences of this flight variation on life history strategies of beetles is unknown. This study assessed the effect of flight on two particular aspects of beetle biology: (1) an energetic trade-off between flight distance and host colonisation capacity; and (2) the relationship between flight distance and pheromone production. A 23 h flight treatment was applied to a subset of beetles using computer-linked flight mills. After flight treatment, both flown and unflown (control) beetles were given the opportunity to colonise bolts of host trees, and beetles that entered hosts were aerated to collect pheromone. A trade-off occurred between initiation of host colonisation and percentage body mass lost during flight, which indicates energy use during flight affects host acceptance in female mountain pine beetles. Furthermore, production of the aggregation pheromone trans-verbenol by female beetles was influenced by both percentage body mass lost during flight and flight distance. Male production of exo-brevicomin was affected by beetle condition following flight but not by the energy used during flight. These novel results give new insight into the polyphenic flight behaviour of mountain pine beetles. Flight variation is adaptive by acting to maintain population levels through safe and risky host colonisation strategies. These findings suggest mechanisms that facilitate the extremities of the continuous flight polyphenism spectrum. These opposing mechanisms appear to maintain the high variation in flight exhibited by this species. Highlighted Article: The relationship between energy use during flight and host colonisation in the mountain pine beetle suggests potential selection mechanisms maintaining flight polyphenisms.",TRUE
Mechanisms of membrane fusion: disparate players and common principles,"Membrane fusion can occur between cells, between different intracellular compartments, between intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane and between lipid-bound structures such as viral particles and cellular membranes. In order for membranes to fuse they must first be brought together. The more highly curved a membrane is, the more fusogenic it becomes. We discuss how proteins, including SNAREs, synaptotagmins and viral fusion proteins, might mediate close membrane apposition and induction of membrane curvature to drive diverse fusion processes. We also highlight common principles that can be derived from the analysis of the role of these proteins.",TRUE
Mechanosensory hairs in bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) detect weak electric fields,"Significance Electroreception in terrestrial animals is poorly understood. In bumblebees, the mechanical response of filiform hairs in the presence of electric fields provides key evidence for electrosensitivity to ecologically relevant electric fields. Mechanosensory hairs in arthropods have been shown to function as fluid flow or sound particle velocity receivers. The present work provides direct evidence for additional, nonexclusive functionality involving electrical Coulomb-force coupling between distant charged objects and mechanosensory hairs. Thus, the sensory mechanism is proposed to rely on electromechanical coupling, whereby many light thin hairs serve the detection of the electrical field surrounding a bumblebee approaching a flower. This finding prompts the possibility that other terrestrial animals use such sensory hairs to detect and respond to electric fields. Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) use information from surrounding electric fields to make foraging decisions. Electroreception in air, a nonconductive medium, is a recently discovered sensory capacity of insects, yet the sensory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigate two putative electric field sensors: antennae and mechanosensory hairs. Examining their mechanical and neural response, we show that electric fields cause deflections in both antennae and hairs. Hairs respond with a greater median velocity, displacement, and angular displacement than antennae. Extracellular recordings from the antennae do not show any electrophysiological correlates to these mechanical deflections. In contrast, hair deflections in response to an electric field elicited neural activity. Mechanical deflections of both hairs and antennae increase with the electric charge carried by the bumblebee. From this evidence, we conclude that sensory hairs are a site of electroreception in the bumblebee.",TRUE
Mediation of pyrethroid insecticide toxicity to honey bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases.,"Honey bees, Apis mellifera L., often thought to be extremely susceptible to insecticides in general, exhibit considerable variation in tolerance to pyrethroid insecticides. Although some pyrethroids, such as cyfluthrin and lambda-cyhalothrin, are highly toxic to honey bees, the toxicity of tau-fluvalinate is low enough to warrant its use to control parasitic mites inside honey bee colonies. Metabolic insecticide resistance in other insects is mediated by three major groups of detoxifying enzymes: the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), the carboxylesterases (COEs), and the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). To test the role of metabolic detoxification in mediating the relatively low toxicity of tau-fluvalinate compared with more toxic pyrethroid insecticides, we examined the effects of piperonyl butoxide (PBO), S,S,S-tributylphosphorotrithioate (DEF), and diethyl maleate (DEM) on the toxicity of these pyrethroids. The toxicity of the three pyrethroids to bees was greatly synergized by the P450 inhibitor PBO and synergized at low levels by the carboxylesterase inhibitor DEF. Little synergism was observed with DEM. These results suggest that metabolic detoxification, especially that mediated by P450s, contributes significantly to honey bee tolerance of pyrethroid insecticides. The potent synergism between tau-fluvalinate and PBO suggests that P450s are especially important in the detoxification of this pyrethroid and explains the ability of honey bees to tolerate its presence.",TRUE

"Metabolic rate in common shrews is unaffected by temperature, leading to lower energetic costs through seasonal size reduction","Small endothermic mammals have high metabolisms, particularly at cold temperatures. In the light of this, some species have evolved a seemingly illogical strategy: they reduce the size of the brain and several organs to become even smaller in winter. To test how this morphological strategy affects energy consumption across seasonally shifting ambient temperatures, we measured oxygen consumption and behaviour in the three seasonal phenotypes of the common shrew (Sorex araneus), which differ in size by about 20%. Body mass was the main driver of oxygen consumption, not the reduction of metabolically expensive brain mass. Against our expectations, we found no change in relative oxygen consumption with low ambient temperature. Thus, smaller body size in winter resulted in significant absolute energy savings. This finding could only partly be explained by an increase of lower cost behaviours in the activity budgets. Our findings highlight that these shrews manage to avoid one of the most fundamental and intuitive rules of ecology, allowing them to subsist with lower resource availability and successfully survive the harsh conditions of winter.",TRUE
Metal reduction kinetics in Shewanella,"MOTIVATIONMetal reduction kinetics have been studied in cultures of dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria which include the Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1. Estimation of system parameters from time-series data faces obstructions in the implementation depending on the choice of the mathematical model that captures the observed dynamics. The modeling of metal reduction is often based on Michaelis-Menten equations. These models are often developed using initial in vitro reaction rates and seldom match with in vivo reduction profiles.RESULTSFor metal reduction studies, we propose a model that is based on the power law representation that is effectively applied to the kinetics of metal reduction. The method yields reasonable parameter estimates and is illustrated with the analysis of time-series data that describes the dynamics of metal reduction in S.oneidensis strain MR-1. In addition, mixed metal studies involving the reduction of Uranyl (U(VI)) to the relatively insoluble tetravalent form (U(IV)) by S. alga strain (BR-Y) were studied in the presence of environmentally relevant iron hydrous oxides. For mixed metals, parameter estimation and curve fitting are accomplished with a generalized least squares formulation that handles systems of ordinary differential equations and is implemented in Matlab. It consists of an optimization algorithm (Levenberg-Marquardt, LSQCURVEFIT) and a numerical ODE solver. Simulation with the estimated parameters indicates that the model captures the experimental data quite well. The model uses the estimated parameters to predict the reduction rates of metals and mixed metals at varying concentrations.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATIONSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",TRUE
Micro-structure and mechanical properties of the turtle carapace as a biological composite shield.,"Turtle shell is a multi-scale bio-composite in which the components are arranged in various spatial patterns, leading to an unusually strong and durable structure. The keratin-coated dorsal shell, termed the carapace, exhibits a flat bone, sandwich-like structure made up of two exterior cortices enclosing a cancellous interior. This unique structure was developed by nature to protect the reptile from predator attacks by sustaining impact loads and dissipating energy. In the present study we attempt to correlate the micro-scale architecture with the mechanical properties of the carapace sub-regions of the red-eared slider turtle. The microscopic structural features were examined by scanning electron microscopy and micro-computed tomography. Nanoindentation tests were performed under dry and wet conditions on orthogonal anatomical planes to evaluate the elastic modulus and hardness of the various carapace sub-regions. The mineral content was also measured in the different regions of the carapace. Consequently, we discuss the influence of hydration on the carapace sub-regions and the contribution of each sub-region to the overall mechanical resistance of the assemblage.",TRUE
Microbial Biosynthesis of Alkanes,"Toward Alkane Synthesis Alkanes are major components of fossil fuels, and synthesis of alkanes remains a challenge in the conversion of renewable raw materials to fuels. Even though diverse organisms synthesize alkanes, synthesis pathways have remained elusive. Now Schirmer et al. (p. 559) describe an alkane biosynthesis pathway in cyanobacteria that converts intermediates of fatty acid metabolism to alkanes and alkenes. Heterologous expression of the biosynthetic genes resulted in production of alkanes in Escherichia coli. This pathway is likely to be a valuable tool in the production of biofuels. Alkane biosynthesis genes were identified in cyanobacteria and engineered into Escherichia coli for recombinant hydrocarbon production. Alkanes, the major constituents of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, are naturally produced by diverse species; however, the genetics and biochemistry behind this biology have remained elusive. Here we describe the discovery of an alkane biosynthesis pathway from cyanobacteria. The pathway consists of an acyl‚Äìacyl carrier protein reductase and an aldehyde decarbonylase, which together convert intermediates of fatty acid metabolism to alkanes and alkenes. The aldehyde decarbonylase is related to the broadly functional nonheme diiron enzymes. Heterologous expression of the alkane operon in Escherichia coli leads to the production and secretion of C13 to C17 mixtures of alkanes and alkenes. These genes and enzymes can now be leveraged for the simple and direct conversion of renewable raw materials to fungible hydrocarbon fuels.",TRUE
Microbial degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in a polluted tropical stream,"SummaryCrude oil degradation was observed in water samples from three sites along the course of a polluted stream in Lagos, Nigeria. Consistent increase and decrease in the total viable counts (TVCs) of indigenous organisms occurred in the test and control experiments, respectively. Enrichments of the water samples with crude oil resulted in the isolation of nine bacteria belonging to seven genera. A mixed culture was developed from the assemblage of the nine species. The defined microbial consortium utilized a wide range of pure HCs including cycloalkane and aromatic HCs. Utilization of crude oil and petroleum cuts, i.e., kerosene and diesel resulted in an increase in TVC (till day 10) concomitant with decreases in pH and residual oil concentration. Crude oil, diesel and kerosene were degraded by 88, 85 and 78%, respectively, in 14¬†days. Substrate uptake studies with axenic cultures showed that growth was not sustainable on either cyclohexane or aromatics while degradation of the petroleum fractions fell below 67% in spite of extended incubation period (20¬†day). From the GC analysis of recovered oil, while reductions in peaks of n-alkane fractions and in biomarkers namely n-C17/pristane and n-C18/phytane ratios were observed in culture fluids of pure strains, complete removal of all the HC components of kerosene, diesel and crude oil including the isoprenoids was obtained with the consortium within 14¬†days.",TRUE
Microbial diversity drives carbon use efficiency in a model soil,"Empirical evidence for the response of soil carbon cycling to the combined effects of warming, drought and diversity loss is scarce. Microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) plays a central role in regulating the flow of carbon through soil, yet how biotic and abiotic factors interact to drive it remains unclear. Here, we combine distinct community inocula (a biotic factor) with different temperature and moisture conditions (abiotic factors) to manipulate microbial diversity and community structure within a model soil. While community composition and diversity are the strongest predictors of CUE, abiotic factors modulated the relationship between diversity and CUE, with CUE being positively correlated with bacterial diversity only under high moisture. Altogether these results indicate that the diversity √ó ecosystem-function relationship can be impaired under non-favorable conditions in soils, and that to understand changes in soil C cycling we need to account for the multiple facets of global changes. Microbial carbon use efficiency has an important role in soil C cycling. Here the authors test the interactive effects of temperature and moisture and manipulate microbial community composition in soil microcosms, showing a positive relationship between microbial diversity and CUE that is contingent on abiotic conditions.",TRUE
Microbial ecology meets electrochemistry: electricity-driven and driving communities,"Bio-electrochemical systems (BESs) have recently emerged as an exciting technology. In a BES, bacteria interact with electrodes using electrons, which are either removed or supplied through an electrical circuit. The most-described type of BES is microbial fuel cells (MFCs), in which useful power is generated from electron donors as, for example, present in wastewater. This form of charge transport, known as extracellular electron transfer, was previously extensively described with respect to metals such as iron and manganese. The importance of these interactions in global biogeochemical cycles is essentially undisputed. A wide variety of bacteria can participate in extracellular electron transfer, and this phenomenon is far more widespread than previously thought. The use of BESs in diverse research projects is helping elucidate the mechanism by which bacteria shuttle electrons externally. New forms of interactions between bacteria have been discovered demonstrating how multiple populations within microbial communities can co-operate to achieve energy generation. New environmental processes that were difficult to observe or study previously can now be simulated and improved via BESs. Whereas pure culture studies make up the majority of the studies performed thus far, even greater contributions of BESs are expected to occur in natural environments and with mixed microbial communities. Owing to their versatility, unmatched level of control and capacity to sustain novel processes, BESs might well serve as the foundation of a new environmental biotechnology. While highlighting some of the major breakthroughs and addressing only recently obtained data, this review points out that despite rapid progress, many questions remain unanswered.",TRUE
Micromechanics of plant tissues beyond the linear-elastic range,"Abstract. We investigated the relation between cell wall structure and the resulting mechanical characteristics of different plant tissues. Special attention was paid to the mechanical behaviour beyond the linear-elastic range, the underlying micromechanical processes and the fracture characteristics. The previously proposed model of reorientation and slippage of the cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall [H.-CH. Spatz et al. (1999) J Exp Biol 202:3269‚Äì3272) was supported and is here refined, using measurements of the changes in microfibrillar angle during straining. Our model explains the widespread phenomenon of stress-strain curves with two linear portions of different slope and sheds light on the micromechanical processes involved in viscoelasticity and plastic yield. We also analysed the velocity dependence of viscoelasticity under the perspective of the Kelvin model, resolving the measured viscoelasticity into functions of a velocity-dependent and a velocity-independent friction. The influence of lignin on the above-mentioned mechanical properties was examined by chemical lignin extraction from tissues of Aristolochia macrophylla Lam. and by the use of transgenic plants of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. with reduced lignin content. Additionally, the influence of extraction of hemicelluloses on the mechanical properties was investigated as well as a cell wall mutant of Arabidopsis with an altered configuration of the cellulose microfibrils.",TRUE
Micromechanics of the equine hoof wall: optimizing crack control and material stiffness through modulation of the properties of keratin,"Small-scale components of the equine hoof wall were tested to determine their mechanical roles in the morphological hierarchy. Macroscale tensile tests conducted on samples of the inner wall tubules and intertubular material showed a sixfold difference in mean initial stiffnesses (0.47 and 0.08 GPa, respectively), indicating that the inner wall tubules stiffen the wall along its longitudinal axis. The similarity in material properties of tubule and intertubular samples from the mid-wall suggests that tubules in this region offer only minor reinforcement along the longitudinal axis. Microscale tests conducted on rows of keratin strands from the inner wall tubules and intertubular material, and on intertubular keratin strands of the mid-wall, produced estimates of the stiffnesses of the hydrated matrix (0.03 GPa) and intermediate filament (IF; 3-4 GPa) components of the nanoscale ( &agr; -keratin) composite. The results from these tests also suggest that the properties of the keratin composite vary through the wall thickness. Birefringence measurements on inner wall and mid-wall regions agree with these observations and suggest that, although the keratin IF volume fraction is locally constant, the volume fraction changes through the thickness of the wall. These findings imply that modulation of the hoof wall properties has been achieved by varying the IF volume fraction, countering the effects of specific IF alignments which serve another function and would otherwise adversely affect the modulus of a particular region.",TRUE
Microstructured barbs on the North American porcupine quill enable easy tissue penetration and difficult removal,"North American porcupines are well known for their specialized hairs, or quills that feature microscopic backward-facing deployable barbs that are used in self-defense. Herein we show that the natural quill‚Äôs geometry enables easy penetration and high tissue adhesion where the barbs specifically contribute to adhesion and unexpectedly, dramatically reduce the force required to penetrate tissue. Reduced penetration force is achieved by topography that appears to create stress concentrations along regions of the quill where the cross sectional diameter grows rapidly, facilitating cutting of the tissue. Barbs located near the first geometrical transition zone exhibit the most substantial impact on minimizing the force required for penetration. Barbs at the tip of the quill independently exhibit the greatest impact on tissue adhesion force and the cooperation between barbs in the 0‚Äì2 mm and 2‚Äì4 mm regions appears critical to enhance tissue adhesion force. The dual functions of barbs were reproduced with replica molded synthetic polyurethane quills. These findings should serve as the basis for the development of bio-inspired devices such as tissue adhesives or needles, trocars, and vascular tunnelers where minimizing the penetration force is important to prevent collateral damage.",TRUE
Microtubule assembly dynamics: new insights at the nanoscale.,"Although the dynamic self-assembly behavior of microtubule ends has been well characterized at the spatial resolution of light microscopy (~200 nm), the single-molecule events that lead to these dynamics are less clear. Recently, a number of in vitro studies used novel approaches combining laser tweezers, microfabricated chambers, and high-resolution tracking of microtubule-bound beads to characterize mechanochemical aspects of MT dynamics at nanometer scale resolution. In addition, computational modeling is providing a framework for integrating these experimental results into physically plausible models of molecular scale microtubule dynamics. These nanoscale studies are providing new fundamental insights about microtubule assembly, and will be important for advancing our understanding of how microtubule dynamic instability is regulated in vivo via microtubule-associated proteins, therapeutic agents, and mechanical forces.",TRUE
Microtubule catastrophe and rescue.,"Microtubules are long cylindrical polymers composed of tubulin subunits. In cells, microtubules play an essential role in architecture and motility.

To accomplish these varied functions, networks of microtubules in cells are very dynamic, continuously remodeling through stochastic length fluctuations at the ends of individual microtubules. The dynamic behavior at the end of an individual microtubule is termed 'dynamic instability'. This behavior manifests itself by periods of persistent microtubule growth interrupted by occasional switching to rapid shrinkage (called microtubule 'catastrophe'), and then by switching back from shrinkage to growth (called microtubule 'rescue'). In this review, we summarize recent findings which provide new insights into the mechanisms of microtubule catastrophe and rescue, and discuss the impact of these findings in regards to the role of microtubule dynamics inside of cells.",TRUE
Mimosa pudica: Electrical and mechanical stimulation of plant movements.,"Thigmonastic movements in the sensitive plant Mimosa pudica L., associated with fast responses to environmental stimuli, appear to be regulated through electrical and chemical signal transductions. The thigmonastic responses of M. pudica can be considered in three stages: stimulus perception, electrical signal transmission and induction of mechanical, hydrodynamical and biochemical responses. We investigated the mechanical movements of the pinnae and petioles in M. pudica induced by the electrical stimulation of a pulvinus, petiole, secondary pulvinus or pinna by a low electrical voltage and charge. The threshold value was 1.3-1.5 V of applied voltage and 2 to 10 microC of charge for the closing of the pinnules. Both voltage and electrical charge are responsible for the electro-stimulated closing of a leaf. The mechanism behind closing the leaf in M. pudica is discussed. The hydroelastic curvature mechanism closely describes the kinetics of M. pudica leaf movements.",TRUE
Mode of action of teixobactins in cellular membranes,"The natural antibiotic teixobactin kills pathogenic bacteria without detectable resistance. The difficult synthesis and unfavourable solubility of teixobactin require modifications, yet insufficient knowledge on its binding mode impedes the hunt for superior analogues. Thus far, teixobactins are assumed to kill bacteria by binding to cognate cell wall precursors (Lipid II and III). Here we present the binding mode of teixobactins in cellular membranes using solid-state NMR, microscopy, and affinity assays. We solve the structure of the complex formed by an improved teixobactin-analogue and Lipid II and reveal how teixobactins recognize a broad spectrum of targets. Unexpectedly, we find that teixobactins only weakly bind to Lipid II in cellular membranes, implying the direct interaction with cell wall precursors is not the sole killing mechanism. Our data suggest an additional mechanism affords the excellent activity of teixobactins, which can block the cell wall biosynthesis by capturing precursors in massive clusters on membranes. The natural antibiotic teixobactin kills bacteria by direct binding to their cognate cell wall precursors (Lipid II and III). Here authors use solid-state NMR to reveal the native binding mode of teixobactins and show that teixobactins only weakly bind to Lipid II in anionic cellular membranes.",TRUE
Modelling of the frictional behaviour of the snake skin covered by anisotropic surface nanostructures,"Previous experimental data clearly revealed anisotropic friction on the ventral scale surface of snakes. However, it is known that frictional properties of the ventral surface of the snake skin range in a very broad range and the degree of anisotropy ranges as well to a quite strong extent. This might be due to the variety of species studied, diversity of approaches used for the friction characterization, and/or due to the variety of substrates used as a counterpart in the experiments. In order to understand the interactions between the nanostructure arrays of the ventral surface of the snake skin, this study was undertaken, which is aimed at numerical modeling of frictional properties of the structurally anisotropic surfaces in contact with various size of asperities. The model shows that frictional anisotropy appears on the snake skin only on the substrates with a characteristic range of roughness, which is less or comparable with dimensions of the skin microstructure. In other words, scale of the skin relief should reflect an adaptation to the particular range of surfaces asperities of the substrate.",TRUE

Molecular Basis of Infrared Detection by Snakes,"Snakes possess a unique sensory system for detecting infrared radiation, enabling them to generate a ‚Äòthermal image‚Äô of predators or prey. Infrared signals are initially received by the pit organ, a highly specialized facial structure that is innervated by nerve fibres of the somatosensory system. How this organ detects and transduces infrared signals into nerve impulses is not known. Here we use an unbiased transcriptional profiling approach to identify TRPA1 channels as infrared receptors on sensory nerve fibres that innervate the pit organ. TRPA1 orthologues from pit-bearing snakes (vipers, pythons and boas) are the most heat-sensitive vertebrate ion channels thus far identified, consistent with their role as primary transducers of infrared stimuli. Thus, snakes detect infrared signals through a mechanism involving radiant heating of the pit organ, rather than photochemical transduction. These findings illustrate the broad evolutionary tuning of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels as thermosensors in the vertebrate nervous system.",TRUE
Molecular insights into the powerful mucus-based adhesion of limpets (Patella vulgata L.),"Limpets (Patella vulgata L.) are renowned for their powerful attachments to rocks on wave-swept seashores. Unlike adult barnacles and mussels, limpets do not adhere permanently; instead, they repeatedly transition between long-term adhesion and locomotive adhesion depending on the tide. Recent studies on the adhesive secretions (bio-adhesives) of marine invertebrates have expanded our knowledge on the composition and function of temporary and permanent bio-adhesives. In comparison, our understanding of the limpets' transitory adhesion remains limited. In this study, we demonstrate that suction is not the primary attachment mechanism in P. vulgata; rather, they secrete specialized pedal mucus for glue-like adhesion. Through combined transcriptomics and proteomics, we identified 171 protein sequences from the pedal mucus. Several of these proteins contain conserved domains found in temporary bio-adhesives from sea stars, sea urchins, marine flatworms and sea anemones. Many of these proteins share homology with fibrous gel-forming glycoproteins, including fibrillin, hemolectin and SCO-spondin. Moreover, proteins with potential protein- and glycan-degrading domains could have an immune defence role or assist degrading adhesive mucus to facilitate the transition from stationary to locomotive states. We also discovered glycosylation patterns unique to the pedal mucus, indicating that specific sugars may be involved in transitory adhesion. Our findings elucidate the mechanisms underlying P. vulgata adhesion and provide opportunities for future studies on bio-adhesives that form strong attachments and resist degradation until necessary for locomotion.",TRUE
Molecular nanosprings in spider capture-silk threads,"Spider capture silk is a natural material that outperforms almost any synthetic material in its combination of strength and elasticity. The structure of this remarkable material is still largely unknown, because spider-silk proteins have not been crystallized. Capture silk is the sticky spiral in the webs of orb-weaving spiders. Here we are investigating specifically the capture spiral threads from Araneus, an ecribellate orb-weaving spider. The major protein of these threads is flagelliform protein, a variety of silk fibroin. We present models for molecular and supramolecular structures of flagelliform protein, derived from amino acid sequences, force spectroscopy (molecular pulling) and stretching of bulk capture web. Pulling on molecules in capture-silk fibres from Araneus has revealed rupture peaks due to sacrificial bonds, characteristic of other self-healing biomaterials. The overall force changes are exponential for both capture-silk molecules and intact strands of capture silk.",TRUE
Molecular sabotage of plant defense by aphid saliva,"Aphids, which constitute one of the most important groups of agricultural pests, ingest nutrients from sieve tubes, the photoassimilate transport conduits in plants. Aphids are able to successfully puncture sieve tubes with their piercing mouthparts (stylets) and ingest phloem sap without eliciting the sieve tubes' normal occlusion response to injury. Occlusion mechanisms are calcium-triggered and may be prevented by chemical constituents in aphid saliva injected into sieve tubes before and during feeding. We recorded aphid feeding behavior with the electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique and then experimentally induced sieve tube plugging. Initiation of sieve tube occlusion caused a change in aphid behavior from phloem sap ingestion to secretion of watery saliva. Direct proof of ‚Äúunplugging‚Äù properties of aphid saliva was provided by the effect of aphid saliva on forisomes. Forisomes are proteinaceous inclusions in sieve tubes of legumes that show calcium-regulated changes in conformation between a contracted state (below calcium threshold) that does not occlude the sieve tubes and a dispersed state (above calcium threshold) that occludes the sieve tubes. We demonstrated in vitro that aphid saliva induces dispersed forisomes to revert back to the nonplugging contracted state. Labeling Western-blotted saliva proteins with 45Ca2+ or ruthenium red inferred the presence of calcium-binding domains. These results demonstrate that aphid saliva has the ability to prevent sieve tube plugging by molecular interactions between salivary proteins and calcium. This provides aphids with access to a continuous flow of phloem sap and is a critical adaptation instrumental in the evolutionary success of aphids.",TRUE
More diverse plant communities have higher functioning over time due to turnover in complementary dominant species,"More diverse communities have been shown to have higher and more temporally stable ecosystem functioning than less diverse ones, suggesting they should also have a consistently higher level of functioning over time. Diverse communities could maintain consistently high function because the species driving function change over time (functional turnover) or because they are more likely to contain key species with temporally stable functioning. Across 7 y in a large biodiversity experiment, we show that more diverse plant communities had consistently higher productivity, that is, a higher level of functioning over time. We identify the mechanism for this as turnover in the species driving biomass production; this was substantial, and species that were rare in some years became dominant and drove function in other years. Such high turnover allowed functionally more diverse communities to maintain high biomass over time and was associated with higher levels of complementarity effects in these communities. In contrast, turnover in communities composed of functionally similar species did not promote high biomass production over time. Thus, turnover in species promotes consistently high ecosystem function when it sustains functionally complementary interactions between species. Our results strongly reinforce the argument for conservation of high biodiversity.",TRUE
Morphological and kinematic basis of the hummingbird flight stroke: scaling of flight muscle transmission ratio,"Hummingbirds (Trochilidae) are widely known for their insect-like flight strokes characterized by high wing beat frequency, small muscle strains and a highly supinated wing orientation during upstroke that allows for lift production in both halves of the stroke cycle. Here, we show that hummingbirds achieve these functional traits within the limits imposed by a vertebrate endoskeleton and muscle physiology by accentuating a wing inversion mechanism found in other birds and using long-axis rotational movement of the humerus. In hummingbirds, long-axis rotation of the humerus creates additional wing translational movement, supplementing that produced by the humeral elevation and depression movements of a typical avian flight stroke. This adaptation increases the wing-to-muscle-transmission ratio, and is emblematic of a widespread scaling trend among flying animals whereby wing-to-muscle-transmission ratio varies inversely with mass, allowing animals of vastly different sizes to accommodate aerodynamic, biomechanical and physiological constraints on muscle-powered flapping flight.",TRUE
Mosquito hearing: sound-induced antennal vibrations in male and female Aedes aegypti,"Male mosquitoes are attracted by the flight sounds of conspecific females. In males only, the antennal flagellum bears a large number of long hairs and is therefore said to be plumose. As early as 1855, it was proposed that this remarkable antennal anatomy served as a sound-receiving structure. In the present study, the sound-induced vibrations of the antennal flagellum in male and female Aedes aegypti were compared, and the functional significance of the flagellar hairs for audition was examined. In both males and females, the antennae are resonantly tuned mechanical systems that move as simple forced damped harmonic oscillators when acoustically stimulated. The best frequency of the female antenna is around 230 Hz; that of the male is around 380 Hz, which corresponds approximately to the fundamental frequency of female flight sounds. The antennal hairs of males are resonantly tuned to frequencies between approximately 2600 and 3100 Hz and are therefore stiffly coupled to, and move together with, the flagellar shaft when stimulated at biologically relevant frequencies around 380 Hz. Because of this stiff coupling, forces acting on the hairs can be transmitted to the shaft and thus to the auditory sensory organ at the base of the flagellum, a process that is proposed to improve acoustic sensitivity. Indeed, the mechanical sensitivity of the male antenna not only exceeds the sensitivity of the female antenna but also those of all other arthropod movement receivers studied so far.",TRUE
Moth wings are acoustic metamaterials,"Significance Bats and moths are embroiled in an evolutionary arms race. Using ultrasonic biosonar, bats detect their insect prey, which in turn deploy diverse strategies to avoid predation. Here, we show that some moth species evolved wings covered with a canopy of scales that reduces ultrasonic echoes. Our empirical and mathematical analysis together show that moth wings exhibit key features of a desirable technological acoustic metamaterial. This work enriches our understanding of the structural and functional complexity of lepidopteran wings and reveals enticing new ways to design, using bioinspired metamaterial properties, high-performance acoustic panels and noise mitigation devices. Metamaterials assemble multiple subwavelength elements to create structures with extraordinary physical properties (1‚Äì4). Optical metamaterials are rare in nature and no natural acoustic metamaterials are known. Here, we reveal that the intricate scale layer on moth wings forms a metamaterial ultrasound absorber (peak absorption = 72% of sound intensity at 78 kHz) that is 111 times thinner than the longest absorbed wavelength. Individual scales act as resonant (5) unit cells that are linked via a shared wing membrane to form this metamaterial, and collectively they generate hard-to-attain broadband deep-subwavelength absorption. Their collective absorption exceeds the sum of their individual contributions. This sound absorber provides moth wings with acoustic camouflage (6) against echolocating bats. It combines broadband absorption of all frequencies used by bats with light and ultrathin structures that meet aerodynamic constraints on wing weight and thickness. The morphological implementation seen in this evolved acoustic metamaterial reveals enticing ways to design high-performance noise mitigation devices.",TRUE
Moving pieces in a cellular puzzle: a cryptic peptide from the scorpion toxin Ts14 activates AKT and ERK signaling and decreases cardiac myocyte contractility via dephosphorylation of phospholamban.,"Cryptic peptides (cryptides) are biologically active peptides formed after proteolysis of native precursors present in animal venoms, for example. Proteolysis is an overlooked post-translational modification (PTM) that increases venom complexity. The tripeptide KPP (Lys-Pro-Pro) is a peptide encrypted in the C-terminus of Ts14 - a 25-mer peptide from the venom of Tityus serrulatus scorpion that has a positive impact on the cardiovascular system, inducing vasodilation and reducing arterial blood pressure of hypertensive rats, among other beneficial effects. A previous study reported that KPP and its native peptide Ts14 act via activation of the bradykinin receptor B2 (B2R). However, the cellular events underlying the activation of B2R by KPP are unknown. To study the cell signaling triggered by the Ts14 cryptide KPP, we incubated cardiac myocytes isolated from C57BL/6 mice with KPP (10-7 mol.L-1) for 0 min, 5 min or 30 min and explored the proteome and phosphoproteome. Our results showed that KPP regulated cardiomyocyte proteins associated with, but not limited to, apoptosis, muscle contraction, protein turnover, and the respiratory chain. We also reported that KPP led to AKT phosphorylation, activating AKT and its downstream target eNOS. We also observed that KPP led to dephosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) at its activation sites (S16 and T17) leading to reduced contractility of treated cardiomyocytes. Some cellular targets reported here for KPP (e.g., AKT, PLN and ERK) have already been reported to protect cardiac tissue of hypoxia-induced injury. Hence, this study suggests potential beneficial effects of this scorpion cryptide that needs to be further investigated, for example as a drug lead for cardiac infarction.",TRUE
Multimeric single-domain antibody complexes protect against bunyavirus infections,"The World Health Organization has included three bunyaviruses posing an increasing threat to human health on the Blueprint list of viruses likely to cause major epidemics and for which no, or insufficient countermeasures exist. Here, we describe a broadly applicable strategy, based on llama-derived single-domain antibodies (VHHs), for the development of bunyavirus biotherapeutics. The method was validated using the zoonotic Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV), an emerging pathogen of ruminants, as model pathogens. VHH building blocks were assembled into highly potent neutralizing complexes using bacterial superglue technology. The multimeric complexes were shown to reduce and prevent virus-induced morbidity and mortality in mice upon prophylactic administration. Bispecific molecules engineered to present two different VHHs fused to an Fc domain were further shown to be effective upon therapeutic administration. The presented VHH-based technology holds great promise for the development of bunyavirus antiviral therapies.",TRUE
Multiple origins of green coloration in frogs mediated by a novel biliverdin-binding serpin,"Significance Green coloration of vertebrates is normally attributed to pigments and structural components inside skin chromatophores cells. However, these components do not account for the vivid blue-green colors of hundreds of species of frogs with sparse chromatophores. Our study shows that green coloration originates in proteins of the serpin superfamily that bind the pigment biliverdin, modulating its absorbance properties. Using a South American treefrog, we demonstrated that these serpins have a clear ecological role in modulating the reflectance properties and rendering animals cryptic in the foliage even in the near-infrared portion of the spectrum. These findings open up exciting research perspectives both in biochemistry and evolution of serpins, as well as in the study of extracellular protein-mediated coloration in vertebrates. Many vertebrates have distinctive blue-green bones and other tissues due to unusually high biliverdin concentrations‚Äîa phenomenon called chlorosis. Despite its prevalence, the biochemical basis, biology, and evolution of chlorosis are poorly understood. In this study, we show that the occurrence of high biliverdin in anurans (frogs and toads) has evolved multiple times during their evolutionary history, and relies on the same mechanism‚Äîthe presence of a class of serpin family proteins that bind biliverdin. Using a diverse combination of techniques, we purified these serpins from several species of nonmodel treefrogs and developed a pipeline that allowed us to assemble their complete amino acid and nucleotide sequences. The described proteins, hereafter named biliverdin-binding serpins (BBS), have absorption spectra that mimic those of phytochromes and bacteriophytochromes. Our models showed that physiological concentration of BBSs fine-tune the color of the animals, providing the physiological basis for crypsis in green foliage even under near-infrared light. Additionally, we found that these BBSs are most similar to human glycoprotein alpha-1-antitrypsin, but with a remarkable functional diversification. Our results present molecular and functional evidence of recurrent evolution of chlorosis, describe a biliverdin-binding protein in vertebrates, and introduce a function for a member of the serpin superfamily, the largest and most ubiquitous group of protease inhibitors.",TRUE
Muscle and neuronal guidepost-like cells facilitate planarian visual system regeneration,"Guiding regeneration Many adult organisms can regenerate neural circuits after injury. However, it is not clear which guidance mechanisms operate to promote axon path finding in the adult. Scimone et al. addressed this question by investigating regeneration of the planarian visual system (see the Perspective by Roberts-Galbraith). Distinct muscle cell populations were found in close association with photoreceptor axons that, together with a neuron class, facilitated visual system assembly after diverse injuries or eye transplantations. These cells exhibited features similar to embryonic guidepost cells and were specified independently of eyes in precise locations by the action of adult positional information cues. Absence of these guidepost-like cells was associated with defective neuronal wiring in regeneration. Science, this issue p. eaba3203; see also p. 1428 Adult regeneration requires guidepost-like cells for precise rewiring of the eyes in the flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea. INTRODUCTION Multiple strategies exist to promote precise wiring of developing neuronal circuits. One strategy involves guidepost cells, which exist transiently in embryos. Guidepost cells can act as intermediate guidance targets for axons or by providing a scaffold that facilitates axonal targeting. Most guidance mechanisms become dispensable once the circuit is assembled. Loss of guidance mechanisms creates a potential limitation on regeneration of neuronal patterns‚Äîyet some animals are capable of functional regeneration of their nervous system. RATIONALE Assuming some adult animals have the ability to regenerate functional neuronal circuits, they must possess mechanism(s) for de novo repair of neuronal patterns. In this study, we aimed to characterize such mechanisms by studying regeneration of the planarian visual system after diverse injuries. RESULTS We identified a rare subset of muscle cells (notum+; frizzled 5/8-4+) concentrated at two precise anatomical locations and in tight association with photoreceptor axons. The first group of these cells was found near the eye, where visual axons project and fasciculate to form a bundle. The second group of these cells was found near choice points, where sorting of contralateral and ipsilateral axons occurs. Both groups of muscle cells were formed during regeneration of the visual system and were always tightly associated with axonal projections, consistent with a possible role in attraction to facilitate visual system assembly. In addition, we found that a notum+ set of neurons, located at the adult anterior brain commissure, regenerated before axonal midline crossing and was associated with optic chiasm regeneration. We reasoned that if the photoreceptor axon‚Äìassociated notum+; frizzled 5/8-4+ muscle cells have a guidepost-like function, their formation should be independent of eye cells. Eyes transplanted to ectopic anatomical locations did not result in the formation of notum+; frizzled 5/8-4+ muscle cells. Furthermore, animals that were unable to generate eyes [ovo RNA interference (ovo RNAi) animals] were still capable of specifying these muscle cells at the right locations. In addition, we predicted that if these muscle cells were indeed guidepost-like cells, visual axon trajectories should be associated with them after eye transplantation into eyeless heads. In all instances, axons from transplanted eyes projected toward notum+; frizzled 5/8- 4+ muscle cells and often adjusted their trajectories after encountering them. We found that an array of signaling cues, which provide positional information essential for planarian patterning, was required for dictating the precise location of these guidepost-like cells. This provides a visual system‚Äìextrinsic mechanism for placing guidepost-like cells in the adult. Finally, with single-cell RNA sequencing and fluorescent in situ hybridization screening, we identified molecules and transcription factors expressed in these cells. RNAi studies reduced or eliminated muscle or neuronal guidepost-like cell subsets and resulted in aberrant patterns of visual axonal trajectories. CONCLUSION Adult molecular and cellular strategies for regenerating neuronal pattern in the absence of embryo-specific contexts must exist to overcome damage or loss after injury. Understanding these mechanisms might provide important insights for regenerative medicine. Here, we found adult guidepost-like cell populations, extrinsic to the visual system and placed by adult positional information, that promote normal visual system regeneration in planarians. Adult guidepost-like cells facilitate visual system regeneration in planarians. Muscle and neuron guidepost-like cells are present at key locations near the planarian visual system and are formed independently of photoreceptor axons. Regenerating and transplanted eyes target projections to guidepost-like cells. Positional information cues provide an eye-extrinsic mechanism to place guidepost-like cells in the adult. Loss of guidepost-like cells is associated with visual system disruption. wnt-5, slit, and ndk are involved in positional control of guidepost-like cell placement. fz5/8-4, frizzled 5/8-4. Neuronal circuits damaged or lost after injury can be regenerated in some adult organisms, but the mechanisms enabling this process are largely unknown. We used the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea to study visual system regeneration after injury. We identify a rare population of muscle cells tightly associated with photoreceptor axons at stereotyped positions in both uninjured and regenerating animals. Together with a neuronal population, these cells promote de novo assembly of the visual system in diverse injury and eye transplantation contexts. These muscle guidepost-like cells are specified independently of eyes, and their position is defined by an extrinsic array of positional information cues. These findings provide a mechanism, involving adult formation of guidepost-like cells typically observed in embryos, for axon pattern restoration in regeneration.",TRUE
Muscle moment arms of pelvic limb muscles of the ostrich (Struthio camelus),"Muscle moment arms were measured for major muscles of the pelvic limb of the ostrich (Struthio camelus) in order to assess specific functional behaviour and to apply this to locomotor performance. Pelvic limbs of six juvenile ostriches were used for this study. The tendon travel technique was used to measure moment arms of 21 muscles at the hip, knee, ankle and metatarsophalangeal joints throughout the ranges of motion observed during level running. Six of the 21 muscles measured were found to have moment arms that did not change with joint angle, whilst the remainder all demonstrated angle‚Äêdependent changes for at least one of the joints crossed. Moment arm lengths tended to be longest for the large proximal muscles, whilst the largest relative changes were found for the moment arms of the distal muscles. For muscles where moment arm varied with joint angle: all hip muscles were found to have increasing moment arms with extension of the joint, knee flexors were found to have moment arms that increased with extension, knee extensor moment arms were found to increase with flexion and ankle extensor moment arms increased with extension. The greatest relative changes were observed in the flexors of the metatarsophalangeal joint, for which a three‚Äêfold increase in moment arm was observed from flexion to full extension. Changes in muscle moment arm through the range of motion studied appear to optimize muscle function during stance phase, increasing the effective mechanical advantage of these muscles.",TRUE
Mushrooms as Rainmakers: How Spores Act as Nuclei for Raindrops,"Millions of tons of fungal spores are dispersed in the atmosphere every year. These living cells, along with plant spores and pollen grains, may act as nuclei for condensation of water in clouds. Basidiospores released by mushrooms form a significant proportion of these aerosols, particularly above tropical forests. Mushroom spores are discharged from gills by the rapid displacement of a droplet of fluid on the cell surface. This droplet is formed by the condensation of water on the spore surface stimulated by the secretion of mannitol and other hygroscopic sugars. This fluid is carried with the spore during discharge, but evaporates once the spore is airborne. Using environmental electron microscopy, we have demonstrated that droplets reform on spores in humid air. The kinetics of this process suggest that basidiospores are especially effective as nuclei for the formation of large water drops in clouds. Through this mechanism, mushroom spores may promote rainfall in ecosystems that support large populations of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic basidiomycetes. Our research heightens interest in the global significance of the fungi and raises additional concerns about the sustainability of forests that depend on heavy precipitation.",TRUE

Mutations perturbing petal cell shape and anthocyanin synthesis influence bumblebee perception of Antirrhinum majus flower colour,"We wished to understand the effects on pollinator behaviour of single mutations in plant genes controlling flower appearance. To this end, we analysed snapdragon flowers (Antirrhinum majus), including the mixta and nivea mutants, in controlled laboratory conditions using psychophysical tests with bumblebees. The MIXTA locus controls petal epidermal cell shape, and thus the path that incident light takes within the pigment-containing cells. The effect is that mixta mutant flowers are pink in comparison to the wild type purple flowers, and mutants lack the sparkling sheen of wild type flowers that is clearly visible to human observers. Despite their fundamentally different appearance to humans, and even though bees could discriminate the flowers, inexperienced bees exhibited no preference for either type, and the flowers did not differ in their detectability in a Y-maze‚Äîeither when the flowers appeared in front of a homogeneous or a dappled background. Equally counterintuitive effects were found for the non-pigmented, UV reflecting nivea mutant: even though the overall reflectance intensity and UV signal of nivea flowers is several times that of wild type flowers, their detectability was significantly reduced relative to wild type flowers. In addition, na√Øve foragers preferred wild type flowers over nivea mutants, even though these generated a stronger signal in all receptor types. Our results show that single mutations affecting flower signal can have profound effects on pollinator behaviour‚Äîbut not in ways predictable by crude assessments via human perception, nor simple quantification of UV signals. However, current models of bee visual perception predict the observed effects very well.",TRUE
Mutual Feedbacks Maintain Both Genetic and Species Diversity in a Plant Community,"The forces that maintain genetic diversity among individuals and diversity among species are usually studied separately. Nevertheless, diversity at one of these levels may depend on the diversity at the other. We have combined observations of natural populations, quantitative genetics, and field experiments to show that genetic variation in the concentration of an allelopathic secondary compound in Brassica nigra is necessary for the coexistence of B. nigra and its competitor species. In addition, the diversity of competing species was required for the maintenance of genetic variation in the trait within B. nigra. Thus, conservation of species diversity may also necessitate maintenance of the processes that sustain the genetic diversity of each individual species.",TRUE
Mycosporine-glutamicol-glucoside: a natural UV-absorbing secondary metabolite of rock-inhabiting microcolonial fungi,"Microcolonial ascomycetes are known to inhabit bare rock surfaces in cold and hot deserts and thus are habitually exposed to high levels of solar radiation. Several of these stress-tolerant fungal isolates, cultivated in the laboratory under daylight illumination, were studied for the presence of effective UV-radiation protection substances. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analyses allowed for efficient separation and structure clarification of two mycosporines.

Nanopatterned protein microrings from a diatom that direct silica morphogenesis,"Diatoms are eukaryotic microalgae that produce species-specifically structured cell walls made of SiO2 (silica). Formation of the intricate silica structures of diatoms is regarded as a paradigm for biomolecule-controlled self-assembly of three-dimensional, nano- to microscale-patterned inorganic materials. Silica formation involves long-chain polyamines and phosphoproteins (silaffins and silacidins), which are readily soluble in water, and spontaneously form dynamic supramolecular assemblies that accelerate silica deposition and influence silica morphogenesis in vitro. However, synthesis of diatom-like silica structure in vitro has not yet been accomplished, indicating that additional components are required. Here we describe the discovery and intracellular location of six novel proteins (cingulins) that are integral components of a silica-forming organic matrix (microrings) in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. The cingulin-containing microrings are specifically associated with girdle bands, which constitute a substantial part of diatom biosilica. Remarkably, the microrings exhibit protein-based nanopatterns that closely resemble characteristic features of the girdle band silica nanopatterns. Upon the addition of silicic acid the microrings become rapidly mineralized in vitro generating nanopatterned silica replicas of the microring structures. A silica-forming organic matrix with characteristic nanopatterns was also discovered in the diatom Coscinodiscus wailesii, which suggests that preassembled protein-based templates might be general components of the cellular machinery for silica morphogenesis in diatoms. These data provide fundamentally new insight into the molecular mechanisms of biological silica morphogenesis, and may lead to the development of self-assembled 3D mineral forming protein scaffolds with designed nanopatterns for a host of applications in nanotechnology.",TRUE
Nanoscale chemical tomography of buried organic‚Äìinorganic interfaces in the chiton tooth,"Biological organisms possess an unparalleled ability to control the structure and properties of mineralized tissues. They are able, for example, to guide the formation of smoothly curving single crystals or tough, lightweight, self-repairing skeletal elements. In many biominerals, an organic matrix interacts with the mineral as it forms, controls its morphology and polymorph, and is occluded during mineralization. The remarkable functional properties of the resulting composites‚Äîsuch as outstanding fracture toughness and wear resistance‚Äîcan be attributed to buried organic‚Äìinorganic interfaces at multiple hierarchical levels. Analysing and controlling such interfaces at the nanometre length scale is critical also in emerging organic electronic and photovoltaic hybrid materials. However, elucidating the structural and chemical complexity of buried organic‚Äìinorganic interfaces presents a challenge to state-of-the-art imaging techniques. Here we show that pulsed-laser atom-probe tomography reveals three-dimensional chemical maps of organic fibres with a diameter of 5‚Äì10‚Äânm in the surrounding nano-crystalline magnetite (Fe3O4) mineral in the tooth of a marine mollusc, the chiton Chaetopleura apiculata. Remarkably, most fibres co-localize with either sodium or magnesium. Furthermore, clustering of these cations in the fibre indicates a structural level of hierarchy previously undetected. Our results demonstrate that in the chiton tooth, individual organic fibres have different chemical compositions, and therefore probably different functional roles in controlling fibre formation and matrix‚Äìmineral interactions. Atom-probe tomography is able to detect this chemical/structural heterogeneity by virtue of its high three-dimensional spatial resolution and sensitivity across the periodic table. We anticipate that the quantitative analysis and visualization of nanometre-scale interfaces by laser-pulsed atom-probe tomography will contribute greatly to our understanding not only of biominerals (such as bone, dentine and enamel), but also of synthetic organic‚Äìinorganic composites.",TRUE
Nanoscale design of snake skin for reptation locomotions via friction anisotropy.,"Multi-mode scanning probe microscopy is employed to investigate the nanostructure of dermal samples from three types of snakes. Sophisticated friction modifying nanostructures are described. These include an ordered microfibrillar array that can function to achieve mission adaptable friction characteristics. Significant reduction of adhesive forces in the contact areas caused by the 'double-ridge' nanoscale microfibrillar geometry provides ideal conditions for sliding in forward direction with minimum adhesive forces and friction. Low surface adhesion in these local contact points may reduce local wear and skin contamination by environmental debris. The highly asymmetric, 'pawl-like' profile of the microfibrillar ends with radius of curvature 20-40 nm induces friction anisotropy in forward backward motions and serves as an effective stopper for backward motion preserving low friction for forward motion. The system of continuous micropores penetrating through the snake skin may serve as a delivery system for lubrication/anti-adhesive lipid mixture that provides for boundary lubrication of snake skins.",TRUE
Natural Polyesters: Dufour's Gland Macrocyclic Lactones Form Brood Cell Laminesters in Colletes Bees,"Bees in the genus Colletes make their brood cells in the ground and coat them with a highly resistant, waterproof, transparent membrane. This membrane is a polyester constructed mainly from 18-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid and 20-hydroxy-eicosanoic acid, which are stored as their corresponding lactones in the Dufour's gland of the bee. When lining the cells, the bee secretes its glandular content, and the membrane is apparently a product of polycondensation reaction of its contents. This appears to be the first report of a naturally occurring linear polyester. The term laminester (lamina ‚âÉ layer + ester) for this class of compounds is proposed.",TRUE
Nectaries in fly-deceptive pitcher-trap blossoms of Aristolochia,"Abstract The flowers of the eight Aristolochia species studied in this paper (A. arborea, A. clematitis, A. gigantea, A. grandiflora, A. rotunda, A. salvadorensis, A. sempervirens, A. tricaudata) represent three different pollinator deceit cases in this genus: brood site mimic in carrion-fly and fungus-gnat blossoms and food source mimic. In any case, all of them have nectaries on the inner wall of the kettle which provide a small quantity of nectar. As regards the histology, two different types of nectaries can be discerned: the trichomatous type and the so-called nectarioles (termed by Vogel, 1998). The latter type, characterized by clusters of independent and isolated glandular units, is reported for the first time in the kettles of Aristolochia, namely in A. arborea, A. salvadorensis and A. tricaudata. The nectar production in the kettles of the investigated species is regarded as food ensuring survival of the imprisoned pollinators during captivity. Additionally, the location of the nectaries on the inner kettle wall can be interpreted as an adaptation directing the trapped flies to the exit after pollination and fresh pollen loading.",TRUE
Nest ‚Äòmoulting‚Äô in the ant Temnothorax albipennis,"We showed how super-organisms, here ant colonies, modify their home according to their increasing or decreasing space requirements. The ontogeny of wall building by colonies of the ant Temnothorax albipennis involves discontinuous rebuilding events that are reminiscent of moulting in insects. Here for the first time we manipulated worker density by changing nest cavity size instead of worker number, thus avoiding accidentally shifting the balance of workers with different propensities for building tasks. Our results suggest for the first time that history influences wall building in ants when worker density decreases (e.g. with colony diminution) as well as when it increases (e.g. with colony growth) as shown by earlier work. Furthermore, we found that ants used a greater number of the larger building blocks (big sand grains) both after cavity expansion and, more surprisingly, also after cavity contraction. The pattern of nest ‚Äòmoulting‚Äô we experimentally manipulated and analysed should provide insights into possible trade-offs between the various functions and structural properties of the nest that these animals may have to optimize.",TRUE
Nest Carbon Dioxide Masks GABA-Dependent Seizure Susceptibility in the Naked Mole-Rat,"African naked mole-rats were likely the first mammals to evolve eusociality, and thus required adaptations to conserve energy and tolerate the low oxygen (O2) and high carbon dioxide (CO2) of a densely populated fossorial nest. As hypercapnia is known to suppress neuronal activity, we studied whether naked mole-rats might demonstrate energy savings in GABAergic inhibition. Using whole-colony behavioral monitoring of captive naked mole-rats, we found a durable nest, characterized by high CO2 levels, where all colony members spent the majority of their time. Analysis of the naked mole-rat genome revealed, uniquely among mammals, a histidine point variation in the neuronal potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2). A histidine missense substitution mutation at this locus in the human ortholog of KCC2, found previously in patients with febrile seizures and epilepsy, has been demonstrated to diminish neuronal Cl- extrusion capacity, and thus impairs GABAergic inhibition. Seizures were observed, without pharmacological intervention, in adult naked mole-rats exposed to a simulated hyperthermic surface environment, causing systemic hypocapnic alkalosis. Consistent with the diminished function of KCC2, adult naked mole-rats demonstrate a reduced efficacy of inhibition that manifests as triggering of seizures at room temperature by the GABAA receptor (GABAAR) positive allosteric modulator diazepam. These seizures are blocked in the presence of nest-like levels of CO2 and likely to be mediated through GABAAR activity, based on in¬†vitro recordings. Thus, altered GABAergic inhibition adds to a growing list¬†of¬†adaptations in the naked mole-rat and provides a plausible proximate mechanism for nesting behavior, where a return to the colony nest restores GABA-mediated inhibition.",TRUE
"Nesting biology of the mangrove mud-nesting ant Polyrhachis sokolova Forel (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) in northern Australia","Summary: The nest sites of the mud-nesting ant Polyrhachis sokolova were studied in Darwin Harbour mangroves. They were found from the Ceriops tagal zone to the Rhizophora stylosa zone at elevations ranging from 7.22 to 5.99 meters above the lowest astronomical tide (LAT), which means that the nests were inundated in 13‚Äê61% of all high tides and for durations of up to 3.5 hours. The nest structure was studied by excavating nests and making a cast of the galleries using polyurethane foam. The nests were quite extensive, normally with two elevated nest entrances and galleries down to depths of 45 cm. The loose soil particles at the nest entrances collapsed when the tide reached them and formed a stopper which prevented water from intruding into the nest. In this way, the galleries remained dry during high tide. The ants showed a clear swimming or ""walking on the surface"" behaviour when they returned to the nest just before the entrance collapsed and during ebb. The tolerance of the ants to submergence was tested in the laboratory, with 50% mortality after 11 hours submergence in seawater at 23 ¬∞C, and only 3.5 hours in water at 33 ¬∞C. Therefore, the nesting behaviour with trapped air in the galleries is necessary for survival in these environments.",TRUE
Neural Control of Fibrillar Muscles in Bees During Shivering and Flight,"The big indirect flight muscles in the thorax of honeybees and bumblebees show two modes of action: they contract with ‚Äòconventional‚Äô twitches in response to slowly repeated muscle potentials and go into tetanus at higher muscle potential frequencies. They can also contract much faster when quickly stretched (stretch activation).We observed contractions of DV (dorsoventral) and DL (dorsal longitudinal) muscles optically with the help of a tiny mirror glued to the scutellum. We noticed that DL muscles contracted much more than DV muscles during pre-flight warmup. During warm-up, muscle potential frequencies in DL muscles were higher than in DV muscles (DL frequency/DV frequency =1.3), whereas during flight the ratio reversed (DL/DV=0.8). The scutal fissure was completely closed during shivering warm-up, apparently because the DL muscles shortened as much as they could. As a consequence, fast antagonistic stretching was not possible. However, the scutal fissure oscillated between wide open and closed during flight, and antagonists could stretch each other quickly. Flight was started by highly synchronized ‚Äòconventional‚Äô contractions of many muscle elements in DV muscles. Antagonistic stretch-activation during flight led to faster shortening than during shivering warm-up and synchronized all activated muscle elements to produce maximal contractions.The indirect flight muscles of bumblebees were in tetanic contractions during shivering warm-up over the whole range of temperatures between 8 and 36¬∞C. These tetanic contractions probably prevented other researchers from observing mechanical muscle activity. Our results, which for the first time allow us to detect tetanic contractions directly, make it very improbable that non-shivering thermogenesis occurs in bumblebees, as has been proposed previously.",TRUE
Neurology: An ancient sensory organ in crocodilians,"Crocodilians hunt at night, waiting half-submerged for land-bound prey to disturb the water surface. Here I show that crocodilians have specialized sensory organs on their faces that can detect small disruptions in the surface of the surrounding water, and which are linked to a dedicated, hypertrophied nerve system. Such 'dome' pressure receptors are also evident in fossils from the Jurassic period, indicating that these semi-aquatic predators solved the problem of combining armour with tactile sensitivity many millions of years ago.",TRUE
Neurophysiology: Sensing temperature without ion channels,"Mammals use cold-sensitive ion channels to translate information about the temperature of their surroundings into electrical signals that are taken up by thermoreceptor nerve cells. Here I investigate the thermoelectric properties of an extracellular gel removed from the electrosensors of sharks, and show that it develops significant voltages in response to tiny temperature gradients. This bulk property of the gel indicates that temperature can be translated into electrical information without the need for ion channels, a sensitivity that may help sharks to locate thermal fronts as feeding areas.",TRUE
New functional insights into the internal architecture of the laminated anchor spicules of Euplectella aspergillum,"Significance The remarkable properties of biological structural materials can often be attributed to the composite arrangement of their constituents. This paper focuses on the high-aspect-ratio, load-bearing, glassy skeletal fibers (spicules) of the marine sponge Euplectella aspergillum. Considering that the spicules‚Äô internal architecture cannot be repaired or remodeled, we hypothesize that there is a connection between their internal structure and their strength. Using a newly developed structural mechanics model for composite beams, we demonstrate that the unique internal geometry that maximizes a beam‚Äôs strength correlates well with the geometry observed in the native spicules. This bio-inspired design strategy for increasing a beam's strength has implications for a new generation of man-made structural materials. To adapt to a wide range of physically demanding environmental conditions, biological systems have evolved a diverse variety of robust skeletal architectures. One such example, Euplectella aspergillum, is a sediment-dwelling marine sponge that is anchored into the sea floor by a flexible holdfast apparatus consisting of thousands of anchor spicules (long, hair-like glassy fibers). Each spicule is covered with recurved barbs and has an internal architecture consisting of a solid core of silica surrounded by an assembly of coaxial silica cylinders, each of which is separated by a thin organic layer. The thickness of each silica cylinder progressively decreases from the spicule‚Äôs core to its periphery, which we hypothesize is an adaptation for redistributing internal stresses, thus increasing the overall strength of each spicule. To evaluate this hypothesis, we created a spicule structural mechanics model, in which we fixed the radii of the silica cylinders such that the force transmitted from the surface barbs to the remainder of the skeletal system was maximized. Compared with measurements of these parameters in the native sponge spicules, our modeling results correlate remarkably well, highlighting the beneficial nature of this elastically heterogeneous lamellar design strategy. The structural principles obtained from this study thus provide potential design insights for the fabrication of high-strength beams for load-bearing applications through the modification of their internal architecture, rather than their external geometry.",TRUE
New materials for solar thermal storage‚Äîsolid/liquid transitions in fatty acid esters,"Abstract Solid/liquid transitions were studied by DSC measurements in the following fatty acid esters: methyl stearate, methyl palmitate, cetyl stearate, cetyl palmitate and their binary mixtures. Four systems, with phase transition temperature close to room temperature and with high enthalpy of transition and low hysteresis, were selected for further studies relevant to passive solar thermal storage. The selected systems were: methyl palmitate and the eutectic mixtures of methyl stearate‚Äìmethyl palmitate, methyl stearte‚Äìcetyl palmitate and methyl stearate‚Äìcetyl stearate. The samples, studied in 50 thermal cycles with programmed heating/cooling in the temperature range ‚àí10‚Äì60¬∞C remained stable. The studies of the samples, having been stored at room temperature, were repeated after an interval of 18 months. The results showed that the relevant thermophysical properties did not change. The commercial building materials (gypsum, bricks) were impregnated homogeneously with the selected molten esters by simple immersion.

Nickel hyperaccumulation mechanisms: a review on the current state of knowledge,"Hyperaccumulator plants are unusual plants that accumulate particular metals or metalloids, such as nickel, zinc, cadmium and arsenic, in their living tissues to concentrations that are hundreds to thousands of times greater than what is normal for most plants.

Nitrogen Fixation by Symbiotic and Free-Living Spirochetes,"Spirochetes from termite hindguts and freshwater sediments possessed homologs of a nitrogenase gene (nifH) and exhibited nitrogenase activity, a previously unrecognized metabolic capability in spirochetes.

Results implicate spirochetes in the nitrogen nutrition of termites, whose food is typically low in nitrogen, and in global nitrogen cycling. These results also proffer spirochetes as a likely origin of certainnifHs observed in termite guts and other environments that were not previously attributable to known microbes.",TRUE
"Nitrogen Mineralization, Ammonia Accumulation, and Emission of Gaseous NH3 by Soil-feeding Termites","There are numerous reports on the accumulation of ammonia in the mounds of soil-feeding termites. Here, we provided direct evidence for an effective mineralization of nitrogenous soil organic matter in the gut of Cubitermes spp., which gives rise to enormous ammonia concentrations in the intestinal tract. In Cubitermes ugandensis, the ammonia content of the nest material [24.5¬†Œºmol (g¬†dry¬†wt.)‚àí1] was about 300-fold higher than that of the parent soil. Large amounts of ammonia were present throughout the intestinal tract, with lowest values in the extremely alkaline gut sections (pH >12) and highest values posterior hindgut [185¬†Œºmol (g¬†dry¬†wt.)‚àí1]. Results obtained with other Cubitermes species were similar. Ammonia concentrations in the posterior hindgut of these humivorous species (up to 130¬†mM) are among the highest values ever reported for soil macroinvertebrates and are matched only by insects feeding on an extremely protein-rich diet (e.g., the sarcophageous larvae of blowflies). Volatilization of ammonia [about 10¬†nmol (g¬†fresh¬†wt.)‚àí1¬†h‚àí1], either directly by emission from the termite body or indirectly from their feces, led to NH3 concentrations in the nest atmosphere of C. ugandensis that were three orders of magnitude above the ambient background ‚Äì a relative accumulation that is considerably higher than that observed with CH4 and CO2. Together with previous results, these observations document that through their feeding activity and due to the physicochemical and biochemical properties of their digestive system, soil-feeding termites effectively catalyze the transformation of refractory soil organic nitrogen to a plant-available form that is protected from leaching by adsorption to the nest soil. Nitrogen mineralization rates of soil-feeding termites may surpass those effected by tropical earthworms and should contribute significantly to nitrogen fluxes in tropical ecosystems.",TRUE
"Nitrogen retention in wetlands, lakes and rivers","As human activities continue to alter the global nitrogen cycle, the ability to predict the impact of increased nitrogen loading to freshwater systems is becoming more and more important. Nitrogen retention is of particular interest because it is through its combined processes (denitrification, nitrogen sedimentation and uptake by aquatic plants) that local and downstream nitrogen concentrations are reduced. Here, we compare the magnitude of nitrogen retention and its components in wetlands, lakes and rivers. We show that wetlands retain the highest proportion of total nitrogen loading, followed by lakes and then rivers. The differences in the proportion of N retained among systems is explained almost entirely by differences in water discharge. Denitrification is the primary mechanism of nitrogen retention, followed by nitrogen sedimentation and uptake by aquatic plants.",TRUE
NO-mediated cytoprotection: instant adaptation to oxidative stress in bacteria.,"Numerous sophisticated systems have been described that protect bacteria from increased levels of reactive oxygen species. Although indispensable during prolonged oxidative stress, these response systems depend on newly synthesized proteins, and are hence both time and energy consuming. Here, we describe an ""express"" cytoprotective system in Bacillus subtilis which depends on nitric oxide (NO). We show that NO immediately protects bacterial cells from reactive oxygen species by two independent mechanisms. NO transiently suppresses the enzymatic reduction of free cysteine that fuels the damaging Fenton reaction. In addition, NO directly reactivates catalase, a major antioxidant enzyme that has been inhibited in vivo by endogenous cysteine. Our data also reveal a critical role for bacterial NO-synthase in adaptation to oxidative stress associated with fast metabolic changes, and suggest a possible role for NO in defending pathogens against immune oxidative attack.",TRUE
Non-smooth morphologies of typical plant leaf surfaces and their anti-adhesion effects,"The micromorphologies of surfaces of several typical plant leaves were investigated by scanning electron microscopy(SEM). Different non-smooth surface characteristics were described and classified. The hydrophobicity and anti-adhesion of non-smooth leaf surfaces were quantitatively measured. Results show that the morphology of epidermal cells and the morphology and distribution density of epicuticular wax directly affect the hydrophobicity and anti-adhesion. The surface with uniformly distributed convex units shows the best anti-adhesion, and the surface with regularly arranged trellis units displays better anti-adhesion. In contrast, the surface with randomly distributed hair units performs relatively bad anti-adhesion. The hydrophobic models of papilla-ciliary and fold-setal non-smooth surfaces were set up to determine the impacts of geometric parameters on the hydrophobicity. This study may provide an insight into surface machine molding and apparent morphology design for biomimetics engineering.",TRUE
Non-wetting wings and legs of the cranefly aided by fine structures of the cuticle,"Non-wetting surfaces are imperative to the survival of terrestrial and semi-aquatic insects as they afford resistance to wetting by rain and other liquid surfaces that insects may encounter. Thus, there is an evolutionary pay-off for these insects to adopt hydrophobic technologies, especially on contacting surfaces such as legs and wings. The cranefly is a weak flier, with many species typically found in wet/moist environments where they lay eggs. Water droplets placed on this insect's wings will spontaneously roll off the surface. In addition, the insect can stand on water bodies without its legs penetrating the water surface. The legs and wings of this insect possess thousands of tiny hairs with intricate surface topographies comprising a series of ridges running longitudinally along the long axis of the hair fibre. Here we demonstrate that this fine hair structure enhances the ability of the hairs to resist penetration into water bodies.",TRUE
Nonuniform growth and surface friction determine bacterial biofilm morphology on soft substrates,"Significance Shape transformations during an organism‚Äôs development often arise from mechanical instabilities driven by nonuniform growth. A remarkable example is the formation of 3D wrinkles in bacterial biofilms growing on soft substrates, which may enhance the availability of nutrients and signaling molecules. To investigate the formation of biofilm wrinkle patterns, we developed a chemomechanical model that incorporates nutrient-limited inhomogeneous growth, surface friction, and the ensuing mechanical stresses and deformations. We predict the spatiotemporal stress field in a growing biofilm and how it dictates the formation of 3D biofilm morphology. Our model provides insight into the observed stages of expansion of Vibrio cholerae biofilms and suggests that universal mechanical principles may underlie the formation of 3D morphologies in biofilms across species. During development, organisms acquire three-dimensional (3D) shapes with important physiological consequences. While basic mechanisms underlying morphogenesis are known in eukaryotes, it is often difficult to manipulate them in vivo. To circumvent this issue, here we present a study of developing Vibrio cholerae biofilms grown on agar substrates in which the spatiotemporal morphological patterns were altered by varying the agar concentration. Expanding biofilms are initially flat but later undergo a mechanical instability and become wrinkled. To gain mechanistic insights into this dynamic pattern-formation process, we developed a model that considers diffusion of nutrients and their uptake by bacteria, bacterial growth/biofilm matrix production, mechanical deformation of both the biofilm and the substrate, and the friction between them. Our model shows quantitative agreement with experimental measurements of biofilm expansion dynamics, and it accurately predicts two distinct spatiotemporal patterns observed in the experiments‚Äîthe wrinkles initially appear either in the peripheral region and propagate inward (soft substrate/low friction) or in the central region and propagate outward (stiff substrate/high friction). Our results, which establish that nonuniform growth and friction are fundamental determinants of stress anisotropy and hence biofilm morphology, are broadly applicable to bacterial biofilms with similar morphologies and also provide insight into how other bacterial biofilms form distinct wrinkle patterns. We discuss the implications of forming undulated biofilm morphologies, which may enhance the availability of nutrients and signaling molecules and serve as a ‚Äúbet hedging‚Äù strategy.",TRUE
Novel acetylenic oxylipins from the moss Dicranum scoparium with antifeeding activity against herbivorous slugs.,"Mosses are seldom fed upon even in areas where intense herbivore pressure is observed on other plants. But even more than 100 years after the first investigations of Ernst Stahl on the chemical defense of plants and mosses against slugs and snails we know very little about the nature and biosynthesis of metabolites responsible for moss chemical defense. Dicranum scoparium is an example of a well-defended moss; it is globally distributed in temperate and arctic forests and often occurs in dense patches that show no sign of herbivory. In a recent survey of the volatile oxylipins (products of the oxidative transformation of polyunsaturated fatty acids) from mosses, we identified D. scoparium as a prolific producer of such metabolites. In addition, this moss produces unusual acetylenic cyclopentenones from the dominant acetylenic fatty acid dicranin presumably also by means of oxylipin pathways. Motivated by the observation that oxylipins often serve as defense metabolites or regulators of defense reactions in higher plants, 7] we explored the chemistry and chemical ecology of oxylipins of D. scoparium. As observed in higher plants and diatoms, the production of volatile oxylipins is triggered by mechanical wounding in mosses as well. Comparing the ultraperformance liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS) profiles of methanolic extracts obtained from D. scoparium before and after tissue disruption revealed that a complex mixture of metabolites is produced within seconds after wounding (Figure 1). Owing to the complexity of the chromatograms, we aimed to address the metabolic pathways guided by biosynthetic precursors labeled with stable isotopes. Therefore we prepared monoand dideuterated fatty acids and administered them to the moss (Scheme 1). The acetylenic fatty acid dicranin proved to be of special interest as a precursor of unusual novel oxylipins. After a 10 min administration of monoor dideuterated dicranin suspended in water to frozen powdered moss, a complex mix of deuterated metabolites formed. Since not all oxylipins were chromatographically separated a manual evaluation of UPLC/MS data ran the risk of overlooking relevant signals. We therefore used an automated peak extraction routine that delivers mass/retention time pairs for every compound. These data from nontreated controls and mixtures obtained after treatment with monoor dideuterated dicranin were then evaluated using a canonical analysis of principal coordinates that enabled the rapid identification of dicranin-derived peaks (Figure 1; see the Supporting Information for experimental details). In contrast to the established manual evaluation of UPLC/MS runs this analysis allows an automated quick and comprehensive survey of metabolites derived from labeled precursors. This method covers the entire range of polarities and molecular weights recorded in LC/MS runs and picks up even minor or chromatographically not separated metabolites. The use of two precursors with different degrees of labeling in separate experiments supports the automated evaluation of the chromatogram since the second treatment serves as additional independent replicate (Figure 1c). The use of only one labeled precursor is also feasible, but more care has to be taken in the manual verification of the identified signals to avoid false positive hits. Mass/retention time pairs identified in the canonical analysis were used as guides in the purification of dicranin-derived metabolites using preparative HPLC. Structure elucidation of compounds 2‚Äì6 and 8 was based on oneand two-dimensional NMR as well as UV, IR, and MS data. The structure of 7 was tentatively assigned based on derivatization and GC/MS data. Scheme 1.

Nuthatches eavesdrop on variations in heterospecific chickadee mobbing alarm calls,"Many animals recognize the alarm calls produced by other species, but the amount of information they glean from these eavesdropped signals is unknown. We previously showed that black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) have a sophisticated alarm call system in which they encode complex information about the size and risk of potential predators in variations of a single type of mobbing alarm call. Here we show experimentally that red-breasted nuthatches (Sitta canadensis) respond appropriately to subtle variations of these heterospecific ‚Äúchick-a-dee‚Äù alarm calls, thereby evidencing that they have gained important information about potential predators in their environment.

Obligate oil-degrading marine bacteria,"Over the past few years, a new and ecophysiologically unusual group of marine hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria - the obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (OHCB) - has been recognized and shown to play a significant role in the biological removal of petroleum hydrocarbons from polluted marine waters. The introduction of oil or oil constituents into seawater leads to successive blooms of a relatively limited number of indigenous marine bacterial genera--Alcanivorax, Marinobacter, Thallassolituus, Cycloclasticus, Oleispira and a few others (the OHCB)--which are present at low or undetectable levels before the polluting event. The types of OHCB that bloom depend on the latitude/temperature, salinity, redox and other prevailing physical-chemical factors. These blooms result in the rapid degradation of many oil constituents, a process that can be accelerated further by supplementation with limiting nutrients. Genome sequencing and functional genomic analysis of Alcanivorax borkumensis, the paradigm of OHCB, has provided significant insights into the genomic basis of the efficiency and versatility of its hydrocarbon utilization, the metabolic routes underlying its special hydrocarbon diet, and its ecological success. These and other studies have revealed the potential of OHCB for multiple biotechnological applications that include not only oil pollution mitigation, but also biopolymer production and biocatalysis.",TRUE
Off like a shot: scaling of ballistic tongue projection reveals extremely high performance in small chameleons,"Stretching elastic tissues and using their recoil to power movement allows organisms to release energy more rapidly than by muscle contraction directly, thus amplifying power output. Chameleons employ such a mechanism to ballistically project their tongue up to two body lengths, achieving power outputs nearly three times greater than those possible via muscle contraction. Additionally, small organisms tend to be capable of greater performance than larger species performing similar movements. To test the hypothesis that small chameleon species outperform larger species during ballistic tongue projection, performance was examined during feeding among 20 chameleon species in nine genera. This revealed that small species project their tongues proportionately further than large species, achieving projection distances of 2.5 body lengths. Furthermore, feedings with peak accelerations of 2,590‚Äâm s‚àí2, or 264‚Äâg, and peak power output values of 14,040‚ÄâW kg‚àí1 are reported. These values represent the highest accelerations and power outputs reported for any amniote movement, highlighting the previously underestimated performance capability of the family. These findings show that examining movements in smaller animals may expose movements harbouring cryptic power amplification mechanisms and illustrate how varying metabolic demands may help drive morphological evolution.",TRUE

Ontogenetic changes in tracheal structure facilitate deep dives and cold water foraging in adult leatherback sea turtles,"SUMMARY Adult leatherbacks are large animals (300‚Äì500 kg), overlapping in size with marine pinniped and cetacean species. Unlike marine mammals, they start their aquatic life as 40‚Äì50 g hatchlings, so undergo a 10,000-fold increase in body mass during independent existence. Hatchlings are limited to the tropics and near-surface water. Adults, obligate predators on gelatinous plankton, encounter cold water at depth (<1280 m) or high latitude and are gigantotherms that maintain elevated core body temperatures in cold water. This study shows that there are great ontogenetic changes in tracheal structure related to diving and exposure to cold. Hatchling leatherbacks have a conventional reptilian tracheal structure with circular cartilaginous rings interspersed with extensive connective tissue. The adult trachea is an almost continuous ellipsoidal cartilaginous tube composed of interlocking plates, and will collapse easily in the upper part of the water column during dives, thus avoiding pressure-related structural and physiological problems. It is lined with an extensive, dense erectile vascular plexus that will warm and humidify cold inspired air and possibly retain heat on expiration. A sub-luminal lymphatic plexus is also present. Mammals and birds have independently evolved nasal turbinates to fulfil such a respiratory thermocontrol function; for them, turbinates are regarded as diagnostic of endothermy. This is the first demonstration of a turbinate equivalent in a living reptile.",TRUE
Ontogenetic scaling of burrowing forces in the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris,"In hydrostatic skeletons, it is the internal fluid under pressure surrounded by a body wall in tension (rather than a rigid lever) that enables the stiffening of the organism, the antagonism of muscles and the transmission of force from the muscles to the environment. This study examined the ontogenetic effects of body size on force production by an organism supported with a hydrostatic skeleton. The earthworm Lumbricus terrestris burrows by forcefully enlarging crevices in the soil. I built a force-measuring apparatus that measured the radial forces as earthworms of different sizes crawled through and enlarged pre-formed soil burrows. I also built an apparatus that measured the radial and axial forces as earthworms of different sizes attempted to elongate a dead-end burrow. Earthworms ranging in body mass m(b) from hatchlings (0.012 g) to adults (8.9 g) exerted maximum forces (F, in N) during active radial expansion of their burrows (F=0.32 m(b)(0.43)) and comparable forces during axial elongation of the burrow (F=0.26 m(b)(0.47)). Both these forces were almost an order of magnitude greater than the radial anchoring forces during normal peristalsis within burrows (F=0.04 m(b)(0.45)). All radial and axial forces scaled as body mass raised to the 2/5 power rather than to the 2/3 power expected by geometric similarity, indicating that large worms exert greater forces than small worms on an absolute scale, but the difference was less than predicted by scaling considerations. When forces were normalized by body weight, hatchlings could push 500 times their own body weight, while large adults could push only 10 times their own body weight.",TRUE
Optical properties of the iridescent organ of the comb-jellyfish Bero√´ cucumis (Ctenophora),"Using transmission electron microscopy, analytical modeling, and detailed numerical simulations, the iridescence observed from the comb rows of the ctenophore Bero√´ cucumis was investigated.

Optical solar energy adaptations and radiative temperature control of green leaves and tree barks,"Trees have adapted to keep leaves and barks cool in sunshine and can serve as interesting bionic model systems for radiative cooling. Silicon solar cells, on the other hand, loose up to one third of their energy efficiency due to heating in intensive sunshine. It is shown that green leaves minimize absorption of useful radiation and allow efficient infrared thermal emission. Since elevated temperatures are detrimental for tensile water flow in the Xylem tissue below barks, the optical properties of barks should also have evolved so as to avoid excessive heating. This was tested by performing optical studies with tree bark samples from representative trees. It was found that tree barks have optimized their reflection of incoming sunlight between 0.7 and 2 Œºm. This is approximately the optical window in which solar light is transmitted and reflected by green vegetation. Simultaneously, the tree bark is highly absorbing and thus radiation emitting between 6 and 10 Œºm. These two properties, mainly provided by tannins, create optimal conditions for radiative temperature control. In addition, tannins seem to have adopted a function as mediators for excitation energy towards photo-antioxidative activity for control of radiation damage. The results obtained are used to discuss challenges for future solar cell optimization.",TRUE
Optical structure and function of the white filamentary hair covering the edelweiss bracts,"The optical properties of the inflorescence of the high-altitude Leontopodium nivale subsp. alpinum (edelweiss) is investigated, in relation with its submicrometer structure, as determined by scanning electron microscopy. The filaments forming the hair layer have been found to exhibit an internal structure which may be one of the few examples of a photonic structure found in a plant. Measurements of light transmission through a self-supported layer of hair pads taken from the bracts supports the idea that the wooly layer covering the plant absorbs near-ultraviolet radiation before it reaches the cellular tissue. Calculations based on a photonic-crystal model provide insight on the way radiation can be absorbed by the filamentary threads.",TRUE
"Optical, thermal, and structural characterization of the sclerotized skeleton of two antipatharian coral species","Optical, thermal and structural characterization of the skeleton of two black coral species from the Western Caribbean Sea, Antipathes caribbeana and Antipathes pennacea is presented. Optical spectra in the UV‚ÄìVIS region of both species have a strong absorbance around 350 nm. FTIR spectra in the mid-infrared spectra show the presence of a complex material similar to chitin for both species. X-ray diffraction analyses demanded a deproteinization treatment in order to observe the significant differences in the crystalline structure of chitin. The crystallite size in A. caribbeana is larger than in A. pennacea. Thermal characterization, performed by the photoacoustic technique, shows that in A. caribbeana skeleton the thermal conductivity is higher as compared with the thermal conductivity of the skeleton of A. pennacea. The difference in the thermal properties between coral species could be due to the array and packing of the chitin fiber skeletons.",TRUE
Optimal design of microfluidic networks using biologically inspired principles,"From the earliest of times, Man has sought to replicate ideas that have evolved naturally in plants and animals. Understanding and extracting these ‚Äúnatural‚Äù design strategies has opened up a whole new field of research known as biomimetics. Designs formulated using biologically inspired principles range from novel surface treatments that mimic physiological processes to geometrical optimization for improving the performance of a system. In this paper, we will show how biomimetic principles based on the laws that govern biological vascular trees can be used to design artificial microfluidic distribution systems. The study focuses specifically on microfluidic manifolds composed of constant-depth rectangular- or trapezoidal-sectioned channels, as these geometries can readily be fabricated using standard micro-fabrication techniques. We will show that it is possible to introduce a prescribed element of flow control into the system by carefully selecting the branching parameter that governs the change in channel dimension at each bifurcation.",TRUE
Optimal Localization by Pointing Off Axis,"Detection Versus Localization Active-sensing systems allow an animal some control over the information acquired from the environment. For example, echolocating bats are known to control many aspects of their sonar signal design. However, their sensory data-acquisition strategies are still not fully understood. Yovel et al. (p. 701) found that Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) did not aim their sonar beams directly on target in a standard localization task. Instead, the bats pointed the main lobe of their sonar beam off-axis. Bats approaching the target emitted sounds to the left and right of its localization, in an alternating manner, so that the maximum slope of the change in intensity of the sonar beam was often positioned close to the target. This echolocation strategy is ideal for target localization but occurs at the cost of target detection. Echolocating Egyptian fruit bats do not center their sonar clicks on a target, thereby maximizing localization of the target. Is centering a stimulus in the field of view an optimal strategy to localize and track it? We demonstrated, through experimental and computational studies, that the answer is no. We trained echolocating Egyptian fruit bats to localize a target in complete darkness, and we measured the directional aim of their sonar clicks. The bats did not center the sonar beam on the target, but instead pointed it off axis, accurately directing the maximum slope (‚Äúedge‚Äù) of the beam onto the target. Information-theoretic calculations showed that using the maximum slope is optimal for localizing the target, at the cost of detection. We propose that the tradeoff between detection (optimized at stimulus peak) and localization (optimized at maximum slope) is fundamental to spatial localization and tracking accomplished through hearing, olfaction, and vision.",TRUE
Optimal Predator Risk Assessment by the Sonar-Jamming Arctiine Moth Bertholdia trigona,"Nearly all animals face a tradeoff between seeking food and mates and avoiding predation. Optimal escape theory holds that an animal confronted with a predator should only flee when benefits of flight (increased survival) outweigh the costs (energetic costs, lost foraging time, etc.). We propose a model for prey risk assessment based on the predator's stage of attack. Risk level should increase rapidly from when the predator detects the prey to when it commits to the attack. We tested this hypothesis using a predator ‚Äì the echolocating bat ‚Äì whose active biosonar reveals its stage of attack. We used a prey defense ‚Äì clicking used for sonar jamming by the tiger moth Bertholdia trigona‚Äì that can be readily studied in the field and laboratory and is enacted simultaneously with evasive flight. We predicted that prey employ defenses soon after being detected and targeted, and that prey defensive thresholds discriminate between legitimate predatory threats and false threats where a nearby prey is attacked. Laboratory and field experiments using playbacks of ultrasound signals and naturally behaving bats, respectively, confirmed our predictions. Moths clicked soon after bats detected and targeted them. Also, B. trigona clicking thresholds closely matched predicted optimal thresholds for discriminating legitimate and false predator threats for bats using search and approach phase echolocation ‚Äì the period when bats are searching for and assessing prey. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative study to correlate the sensory stimuli that trigger defensive behaviors with measurements of signals provided by predators during natural attacks in the field. We propose theoretical models for explaining prey risk assessment depending on the availability of cues that reveal a predator's stage of attack.",TRUE
Orange/lemon-scented beetles: opposite enantiomers of limonene as major constituents in the defensive secretion of related carabids,"The major constituent in the pygidial gland defensive fluid of the carabid beetle Ardistomis schaumii is (R)-(+)-limonene, whereas that of Semiardistomis puncticollis is (S)-(‚àí)-limonene. This was an unanticipated result, since it is not very common to find the opposite enantiomers of the same compound among the secondary metabolites of related species. Moreover, the glandular liquid of A. schaumii contains 1,8-cineole, and that of S. puncticollis has Œ≤-pinene, Œ≤-phellandrene, sabinene, and p-cymene. Of about 500 carabid species that have been chemically investigated, this is the first report of the presence of such complex mixtures of monoterpenes in their defensive secretions.",TRUE
Organic solutes in freezing tolerance.,"The accumulation of high levels of low-molecular-weight solutes (polyhydric alcohols, saccharides) provides cryoprotection to freeze-tolerant animals by minimizing, via colligative effects, the percentage of body water converted to extracellular ice and the extent of cell volume reduction. Many freeze-tolerant insects accumulate high levels of polyols during autumn cold hardening, whereas freeze-tolerant frogs respond to ice formation in peripheral tissues by synthesizing large amounts of glucose in the liver and rapidly distributing the sugar throughout the body. Seasonal patterns of enzymatic change occur in cold-hardy insects; activities associated with cryoprotectant synthesis rise in the fall, whereas enzymes associated with polyol degradation dominate in the spring. Enzyme profiles also revealed the route of glycerol degradation via polyol dehydrogenase and the novel enzyme, glyceraldehyde kinase. Proton magnetic resonance imaging of freezing and thawing in whole frogs showed a new adaptive effect of the very high glucose levels in core organs; during thawing, organs such as liver and heart melted first, allowing recovery of their vital functions to begin while the rest of the frog thawed. New studies have examined signal transduction in the stimulation of glucose production by wood frog liver, revealing the key role of beta-adrenergic receptors and cAMP-mediated activation of glycogenolysis for cryoprotectant synthesis. The seasonal elevation of plasma membrane glucose transporters was also shown to be key to cryoprotectant distribution during freezing. Other new work has shown that frog freeze tolerance probably grew out of preexisting mechanisms of amphibian dehydration tolerance and that both freeze-tolerant and -intolerant frogs show a hyperglycemic response to desiccation at 5 degrees C.",TRUE
Organisms as ecosystem engineers,"Interactions between organisms are a major determinant of the distribution and abundance of species. Ecology textbooks (e.g., Ricklefs 1984, Krebs 1985, Begon et al. 1990) summarise these important interactions as intra- and interspecific competition for abiotic and biotic resources, predation, parasitism and mutualism. Conspicuously lacking from the list of key processes in most text books is the role that many organisms play in the creation, modification and maintenance of habitats. These activities do not involve direct trophic interactions between species, but they are nevertheless important and common. The ecological literature is rich in examples of habitat modification by organisms, some of which have been extensively studied (e.g. Thayer 1979, Naiman et al. 1988).",TRUE
Osmotic Regulation in the Crab-Eating Frog (Rana Cancrivora),"1. The osmotic and ionic regulatory abilities of adults of the euryhaline crab-eating frog (Rana cancrivora) have been studied. Adult frogs tolerated environmental salinities as high as 28‚Ä∞ at 30¬∞C. Tadpoles of this form tolerated salinities as high as 39%‚Ä∞ at the same temperature.2. Changes in body weight of frogs following transfers to different environmental salinities indicate both that the skin of this frog is permeable to water and that these animals do not swallow large volumes of external medium, even in high salinities.3. Above salinities of about 9%‚Ä∞, plasma Œî rises with increasing environmental Œî. Plasma Œî is always higher than environmental Œî. Increases in plasma concentration above fresh-water levels are due partly to increased NaCl concentration (about 40%), partly to increased urea concentration (about 60%). Urea concentrations as high as 0.48 M (2.9%) have been measured.4. Urinary Œî parallels plasma Œî, but is always lower than plasma Œî. Considerable quantities of urea are lost via the urine, even though urinary urea levels are below plasma levels.5. Measurements of short-circuit current indicate that active uptake by the skin of inorganic ions continues in R. cancrivora acclimatized to high salinities.6. R. cancrivora is no less susceptible to water loss by evaporation from the skin than are other amphibians.7. In preference experiments R. cancrivora chooses salinities below 18%‚Ä∞, but shows no strong preference for a particular salinity.8. Similar observations on osmoregulatory mechanisms in a close relative of R. cancrivora, the tiger frog (R. tigerina), show that the latter species is similar to ordinary fresh-water frogs.9. The striking physiological convergence between R. cancrivora and the elasmo-branch fishes is discussed, as are various possible implications of our data regarding nitrogen metabolism in tadpoles and kidney function in adult frogs.",TRUE
Overcoming the brittleness of glass through bio-inspiration and micro-architecture.,"Highly mineralized natural materials such as teeth or mollusk shells boast unusual combinations of stiffness, strength and toughness currently unmatched by engineering materials. While high mineral contents provide stiffness and hardness, these materials also contain weaker interfaces with intricate architectures, which can channel propagating cracks into toughening configurations. Here we report the implementation of these features into glass, using a laser engraving technique. Three-dimensional arrays of laser-generated microcracks can deflect and guide larger incoming cracks, following the concept of 'stamp holes'. Jigsaw-like interfaces, infiltrated with polyurethane, furthermore channel cracks into interlocking configurations and pullout mechanisms, significantly enhancing energy dissipation and toughness. Compared with standard glass, which has no microstructure and is brittle, our bio-inspired glass displays built-in mechanisms that make it more deformable and 200 times tougher. This bio-inspired approach, based on carefully architectured interfaces, provides a new pathway to toughening glasses, ceramics or other hard and brittle materials.",TRUE
Oxygen mass transfer in a model three-dimensional artery,"Arterial geometry is commonly non-planar and associated with swirling blood flow. In this study, we examine the effect of arterial three-dimensionality on the distribution of wall shear stress (WSS) and the mass transfer of oxygen from the blood to the vessel wall in a U-bend, by modelling the blood vessels as either cylindrical or helical conduits. The results show that under physiological flow conditions, three-dimensionality can reduce both the range and extent of low WSS regions and substantially increase oxygen flux through the walls. The Sherwood number and WSS distributions between the three-dimensional helical model and a human coronary artery show remarkable qualitative agreement, implying that coronary arteries may potentially be described with a relatively simple idealized three-dimensional model, characterized by a small number of well-defined geometric parameters. The flow pattern downstream of a planar bend results in separation of the Sh number and WSS effects, a finding that implies means of investigating them individually.",TRUE
Parasites and mutualism function: measuring enemy-free space in a fig‚Äìpollinator symbiosis,"Mutualisms involve cooperation between species and underpin several ecosystem functions. However, there is also conflict between mutualists, because their interests are not perfectly aligned. In addition, most mutualisms are exploited by parasites. Here, we study the interplay between cooperation, conflict and parasitism in the mutualism between fig trees and their pollinator wasps. Conflict occurs because each fig ovary can nurture either one seed or one pollinator offspring and, while fig trees benefit directly from seeds and pollinator offspring (pollen vectors), pollinators only benefit directly from pollinator offspring. The mechanism(s) of conflict resolution is debated, but must explain the widespread observation that pollinators develop in inner, and seeds in outer, layers of fig flowers. We recently suggested a role for non-pollinating figs wasps (NPFWs) that are natural enemies or competitors of the pollinators and lay their eggs through the fig wall. Most NPFW offspring develop in outer and middle layer flowers, suggesting that inner flowers provide enemy-free space for pollinator offspring. Here, we test the hypothesis that NPFWs cannot reach inner flowers, by measuring wasp and fig morphology at the species-specific times of NPFW attack in the field. We found that three species of Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis wasps that parasitise pollinators could reach 34‚Äì73%, 75‚Äì92% and 82‚Äì97% of fig ovaries, respectively. Meanwhile, Eukobelea and Pseudidarnes gall-formers, despite having shorter ovipositors, can access almost all fig flowers (93‚Äì99% and 100%), because they attack smaller (younger) fig fruits. Our mechanistic results from ovipositing wasps support spatial patterns of wasp offspring segregation within figs to suggest that inner ovules provide enemy-free-space for pollinators. This may contribute to mutualism stability by helping select for pollinators to avoid laying eggs where they are likely to be parasitised. These outer flowers then remain free to develop as seeds, promoting mutualism persistence.",TRUE
Passive radiative cooling below ambient air temperature under direct sunlight,"Cooling is a significant end-use of energy globally and a major driver of peak electricity demand. Air conditioning, for example, accounts for nearly fifteen per cent of the primary energy used by buildings in the United States. A passive cooling strategy that cools without any electricity input could therefore have a significant impact on global energy consumption. To achieve cooling one needs to be able to reach and maintain a temperature below that of the ambient air. At night, passive cooling below ambient air temperature has been demonstrated using a technique known as radiative cooling, in which a device exposed to the sky is used to radiate heat to outer space through a transparency window in the atmosphere between 8 and 13¬†micrometres. Peak cooling demand, however, occurs during the daytime. Daytime radiative cooling to a temperature below ambient of a surface under direct sunlight has not been achieved because sky access during the day results in heating of the radiative cooler by the Sun. Here, we experimentally demonstrate radiative cooling to nearly 5¬†degrees Celsius below the ambient air temperature under direct sunlight. Using a thermal photonic approach, we introduce an integrated photonic solar reflector and thermal emitter consisting of seven layers of HfO2 and SiO2 that reflects 97 per cent of incident sunlight while emitting strongly and selectively in the atmospheric transparency window. When exposed to direct sunlight exceeding 850 watts per square metre on a rooftop, the photonic radiative cooler cools to 4.9¬†degrees Celsius below ambient air temperature, and has a cooling power of 40.1 watts per square metre at ambient air temperature. These results demonstrate that a tailored, photonic approach can fundamentally enable new technological possibilities for energy efficiency. Further, the cold darkness of the Universe can be used as a renewable thermodynamic resource, even during the hottest hours of the day.",TRUE

Penguin heat-retention structures evolved in a greenhouse Earth,"Penguins (Sphenisciformes) inhabit some of the most extreme environments on Earth. The 60+ Myr fossil record of penguins spans an interval that witnessed dramatic shifts in Cenozoic ocean temperatures and currents, indicating a long interplay between penguin evolution and environmental change. Perhaps the most celebrated example is the successful Late Cenozoic invasion of glacial environments by crown clade penguins. A major adaptation that allows penguins to forage in cold water is the humeral arterial plexus, a vascular counter-current heat exchanger (CCHE) that limits heat loss through the flipper. Fossil evidence reveals that the humeral plexus arose at least 49 Ma during a ‚ÄòGreenhouse Earth‚Äô interval. The evolution of the CCHE is therefore unrelated to global cooling or development of polar ice sheets, but probably represents an adaptation to foraging in subsurface waters at temperate latitudes. As global climate cooled, the CCHE was key to invasion of thermally more demanding environments associated with Antarctic ice sheets.",TRUE
"Peptide tag forming a rapid covalent bond to a protein, through engineering a bacterial adhesin","Protein interactions with peptides generally have low thermodynamic and mechanical stability. Streptococcus pyogenes fibronectin-binding protein FbaB contains a domain with a spontaneous isopeptide bond between Lys and Asp. By splitting this domain and rational engineering of the fragments, we obtained a peptide (SpyTag) which formed an amide bond to its protein partner (SpyCatcher) in minutes. Reaction occurred in high yield simply upon mixing and amidst diverse conditions of pH, temperature, and buffer. SpyTag could be fused at either terminus or internally and reacted specifically at the mammalian cell surface. Peptide binding was not reversed by boiling or competing peptide. Single-molecule dynamic force spectroscopy showed that SpyTag did not separate from SpyCatcher until the force exceeded 1 nN, where covalent bonds snap. The robust reaction conditions and irreversible linkage of SpyTag shed light on spontaneous isopeptide bond formation and should provide a targetable lock in cells and a stable module for new protein architectures.",TRUE
Peptides controlling stifness of connective tissue in sea cucumbers.,"We present the first evidence of a system of four bioactive peptides that affect the stiffness of sea cucumber dermis. The body wall dermis of sea cucumbers consists of catch connective tissue that is characterized by quick and drastic stiffness changes under nervous control. The peptides were isolated from the body wall, their amino acid sequences determined, and identical peptides synthesized. Two peptides, which we named holokinins, are homologous with bradykinin. We tested the effect of the peptides on the mechanical properties of sea cucumber dermis. Both of the holokinins softened the dermis, and a pentapeptide that we designated as NGIWYamide stiffened it. Both effects were reversibly suppressed by anesthesia with menthol. We called the fourth peptide stichopin; it had no direct effect on the stiffness of the dermis but suppressed action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine reversibly. The results suggest that the peptides are neuropeptides and are part of a sophisticated system of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators that controls the connective tissue stiffness of sea cucumber dermis.",TRUE
Periodical Cicadas as Resource Pulses in North American Forests,"Resource pulses are occasional events of ephemeral resource superabundance that occur in many ecosystems. Aboveground consumers in diverse communities often respond strongly to resource pulses, but few studies have investigated the belowground consequences of resource pulses in natural ecosystems. This study shows that resource pulses of 17-year periodical cicadas (Magicicada spp.) directly increase microbial biomass and nitrogen availability in forest soils, with indirect effects on growth and reproduction in forest plants. These findings suggest that pulses of periodical cicadas create ‚Äúbottom-up cascades,‚Äù resulting in strong and reciprocal links between the aboveground and belowground components of a North American forest ecosystem.",TRUE
Phantom hunter of the fjords: Camouflage by counterillumination in a shark (Etmopterus spinax),"Many midwater animals emit ventral light to hide their silhouette in the water column. This phenomenon known as counterillumination typically requires fine control over light emission since it needs a luminescence that closely matches the properties of downwelling light (intensity, angular distribution and wavelength). Here we provide evidence that, although lacking complex structures of counterilluminating animals, the deepwater luminescent shark Etmopterus spinax could, in Norwegian fjords, efficiently cloak its silhouette from downwelling ambient light to remain hidden from predator and prey. This represents the first experimentally tested function of luminescence in a shark and illustrates how evolution can take different routes to converge on identical complex behavior.

Photoelectrochemical complexes for solar energy conversion that chemically and autonomously regenerate,"Naturally occurring photosynthetic systems use elaborate pathways of self-repair to limit the impact of photo-damage. Herein, we demonstrate a complex that mimics this process consisting of two recombinant proteins, phospholipids and a carbon nanotube. The components self-assemble into a configuration in which an array of lipid bilayers aggregate on the surface of the carbon nanotube, creating a platform for the attachment of light-converting proteins. The system can disassemble upon the addition of a surfactant and reassemble on its removal over an indefinite number of cycles. The assembly is thermodynamically meta-stable and can only transition reversibly if the rate of surfactant removal exceeds about 10‚àí5 sec‚àí1. Only in the assembled state do the complexes exhibit photoelectrochemical activity. We demonstrate a regeneration cycle that uses surfactant to switch between assembled and disassembled states, resulting in increased photo-conversion efficiency of more than 300% over 168 hours and an indefinite extension of the system's lifetime.",TRUE
Photonic crystals cause active colour change in chameleons,"Many chameleons, and panther chameleons in particular, have the remarkable ability to exhibit complex and rapid colour changes during social interactions such as male contests or courtship. It is generally interpreted that these changes are due to dispersion/aggregation of pigment-containing organelles within dermal chromatophores. Here, combining microscopy, photometric videography and photonic band-gap modelling, we show that chameleons shift colour through active tuning of a lattice of guanine nanocrystals within a superficial thick layer of dermal iridophores. In addition, we show that a deeper population of iridophores with larger crystals reflects a substantial proportion of sunlight especially in the near-infrared range. The organization of iridophores into two superposed layers constitutes an evolutionary novelty for chameleons, which allows some species to combine efficient camouflage with spectacular display, while potentially providing passive thermal protection.",TRUE
Photoprotection of green plants: a mechanism of ultra-fast thermal energy dissipation in desiccated lichens,"In order to survive sunlight in the absence of water, desiccation-tolerant green plants need to be protected against photooxidation. During drying of the chlorolichen Cladonia rangiformis and the cyanolichen Peltigera neckeri, chlorophyll fluorescence decreased and stable light-dependent charge separation in reaction centers of the photosynthetic apparatus was lost. The presence of light during desiccation increased loss of fluorescence in the chlorolichen more than that in the cyanolichen. Heating of desiccated Cladonia thalli, but not of Peltigera thalli, increased fluorescence emission more after the lichen had been dried in the light than after drying in darkness. Activation of zeaxanthin-dependent energy dissipation by protonation of the PsbS protein of thylakoid membranes was not responsible for the increased loss of chlorophyll fluorescence by the chlorolichen during drying in the light. Glutaraldehyde inhibited loss of chlorophyll fluorescence during drying. Desiccation-induced loss of chlorophyll fluorescence and of light-dependent charge separation are interpreted to indicate activation of a highly effective mechanism of photoprotection in the lichens. Activation is based on desiccation-induced conformational changes of a pigment‚Äìprotein complex. Absorbed light energy is converted into heat within a picosecond or femtosecond time domain. When present during desiccation, light interacts with the structural changes of the protein providing increased photoprotection. Energy dissipation is inactivated and structural changes are reversed when water becomes available again. Reversibility of ultra-fast thermal dissipation of light energy avoids photo-damage in the absence of water and facilitates the use of light for photosynthesis almost as soon as water becomes available.",TRUE
Photosynthetic adaptation of two semi-arid species of Gethyllis (Kukumakranka) to drought-and-shade stress,"Abstract Gethyllis multifolia and Gethyllis villosa are winter-growing, summer-blooming, deciduous and bulbous geophytes that grow naturally in the semi-arid ‚ÄòSucculent Karoo Biome‚Äô of South Africa. G. multifolia is threatened in its natural habitat and resides in the ‚ÄòVulnerable‚Äô category of the ‚ÄòRed Data List of Southern African Plants‚Äô. Previous investigations suggested that G. multifolia is more sensitive to drought stress than G. villosa and that both species adopted certain morphological changes in their leaves during shade stress. Current models indicate that this biome is being exposed to increasingly drier conditions and shading from encroaching indigenous plant species. In this study, the photosynthetic gas exchange responses of both species to drought and shade stresses were investigated and the ‚ÄòVulnerable‚Äô conservation status of G. multifolia. This investigation found that during drought stress G. villosa had a more enhanced photosynthetic performance than G. multifolia which appears not to be related to foliar adaptations such as specific leaf mass (SLM), but to the G. villosa's leaves maintaining their stomatal conductance (Gs), photosynthetic light compensation (LCP) and photon yields. Furthermore, during shade stress G. villosa also had an improved photosynthetic performance by not altering its photosynthetic LCP during reduced light conditions. It can be concluded that G. multifolia has a lower capacity than G. villosa to adapt its photosynthetic apparatus to changing environments such as increasing drought and shaded conditions. This may be a contributing factor to the threatened conservation status of G. multifolia.",TRUE
Phototactic tails: Evolution and molecular basis of a novel sensory trait in sea snakes,"Dermal phototaxis has been reported in a few aquatic vertebrate lineages spanning fish, amphibians and reptiles. These taxa respond to light on the skin of their elongate hind‚Äêbodies and tails by withdrawing under cover to avoid detection by predators. Here, we investigated tail phototaxis in sea snakes (Hydrophiinae), the only reptiles reported to exhibit this sensory behaviour. We conducted behavioural tests in 17 wild‚Äêcaught sea snakes of eight species by illuminating the dorsal surface of the tail and midbody skin using cold white, violet, blue, green and red light. Our results confirmed phototactic tail withdrawal in the previously studied Aipysurus laevis, revealed this trait for the first time in A. duboisii and A. tenuis, and suggested that tail photoreceptors have peak spectral sensitivities between blue and green light (457‚Äì514 nm). Based on these results, and an absence of photoresponses in five Aipysurus and Hydrophis species, we tentatively infer that tail phototaxis evolved in the ancestor of a clade of six Aipysurus species (comprising 10% of all sea snakes). Quantifying tail damage, we found that the probability of sustaining tail injuries was not influenced by tail phototactic ability in snakes. Gene profiling showed that transcriptomes of both tail skin and body skin lacked visual opsins but contained melanopsin (opn4x) in addition to key genes of the retinal regeneration and phototransduction cascades. This work suggests that a nonvisual photoreceptor (e.g., Gq rhabdomeric) signalling pathway underlies tail phototaxis, and provides candidate gene targets for future studies of this unusual sensory innovation in reptiles.",TRUE
Physical and behavioral adaptations to prevent overheating of the living wings of butterflies,"The wings of Lepidoptera contain a matrix of living cells whose function requires appropriate temperatures. However, given their small thermal capacity, wings can overheat rapidly in the sun. Here we analyze butterfly wings across a wide range of simulated environmental conditions, and find that regions containing living cells are maintained at cooler temperatures. Diverse scale nanostructures and non-uniform cuticle thicknesses create a heterogeneous distribution of radiative cooling that selectively reduces the temperature of structures such as wing veins and androconial organs. These tissues are supplied by circulatory, neural and tracheal systems throughout the adult lifetime, indicating that the insect wing is a dynamic, living structure. Behavioral assays show that butterflies use wings to sense visible and infrared radiation, responding with specialized behaviors to prevent overheating of their wings. Our work highlights the physiological importance of wing temperature and how it is exquisitely regulated by structural and behavioral adaptations. Butterfly wings have low thermal capacity and thus are vulnerable to damage by overheating. Here, Tsai et al. take an interdisciplinary approach to reveal the organs, nanostructures and behaviors that enable butterflies to sense and regulate their wing temperature.",TRUE
Physical limits of flight performance in the heaviest soaring bird,"Significance Flapping flight is extremely costly for large birds, yet little is known about the conditions that force them to flap.

Remarkably, condors flapped for only 1% of their flight time, specifically during takeoff and when close to the ground. This is particularly striking as the birds were immature. Thus, our results demonstrate that even inexperienced birds can cover vast distances over land without flapping. Overall, this can help explain how extinct birds with twice the wingspan of condors could have flown.

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF GAMETES IN THREE SEA URCHIN SPECIES,"Physical properties (density in kg m-3, viscosity, sinking rates and dispersion rate) of the gametes and associated spawned materials were measured for three species of sea urchin, Tripneustes gratilla, Echinometra mathaei and Colobocentrotus atratus, from habitats that differ in wave exposure. The gametes of all three species are negatively buoyant, highly viscous and exhibit shear-thinning (a decrease in viscosity with increasing shear rate). Female gametes are more viscous than male gametes, and the viscosity of female gametes differs among the three species. The viscosity of female gametes is highest for C. atratus, the species from habitats most exposed to wave action. Within the species T. gratilla, viscosity of female gametes is higher in habitats exposed to wave action than in more protected habitats. Evidence reported in this paper suggests that the shear-thinning of gametes may provide a performance advantage for these sea urchins. High viscosity of gametes at low shear rates may decrease gamete dispersal upon release and, under certain flow conditions, allow gametes to form strings and clumps on the surface of the urchin. Depending upon the morphology of the surface, these clumps or strings may be retained and fertilization may occur within these clumps or strings. Conversely, low viscosity of gametes at high shear rates decreases the power required to extrude gametes through the gonoduct during spawning.",TRUE
Physical virology,"Viruses are nanosized, genome-filled protein containers with remarkable thermodynamic and mechanical properties. They form by spontaneous self-assembly inside the crowded, heterogeneous cytoplasm of infected cells. Self-assembly of viruses seems to obey the principles of thermodynamically reversible self-assembly but assembled shells (‚Äòcapsids‚Äô) strongly resist disassembly. Following assembly, some viral shells pass through a sequence of coordinated maturation steps that progressively strengthen the capsid. Nanoindentation measurements by atomic force microscopy enable tests of the strength of individual viral capsids. They show that concepts borrowed from macroscopic materials science are surprisingly relevant to viral shells. For example, viral shells exhibit ‚Äòmaterials fatigue‚Äô and the theory of thin-shell elasticity can account ‚Äî¬†in part ‚Äî¬†for atomic-force-microscopy-measured force‚Äìdeformation curves. Viral shells have effective Young‚Äôs moduli ranging from that of polyethylene to that of plexiglas. Some of them can withstand internal osmotic pressures that are tens of atmospheres. Comparisons with thin-shell theory also shed light on nonlinear irreversible processes such as plastic deformation and failure. Finally, atomic force microscopy experiments can quantify the mechanical effects of genome encapsidation and capsid protein mutations on viral shells, providing virological insight and suggesting new biotechnological applications.",TRUE
"Physicochemical characterization of the microhabitat of the epibionts associated with Alvinella pompejana, a hydrothermal vent annelid","Abstract Alvinella pompejana is a polychaetous annelid that inhabits narrow tubes along the walls of high-temperature hydrothermal vent chimneys. The worm hosts a rich community of epibiotic bacteria that coats its dorsal surface. Although the worm tube microhabitat is a challenging environment to sample, characterizing the thermal and geochemical regime is important for understanding the ecology of the worm and its bacteria, as the worm spends most of its time inside the tube. We characterized the physicochemical conditions of diffuse hydrothermal flow inside inhabited worm tubes using in situ analysis and wet chemical analysis of discrete water samples. Thermistor probes deployed inside worm tubes measured temperatures ranging from 28.6¬∞C to 84.0¬∞C, while temperatures at tube orifices ranged from 7.5¬∞C to 40.0¬∞C. In situ electrochemical analysis of tube fluids revealed undetectable oxygen (",TRUE
"Physiological and anatomical changes during the early ontogeny of the heteroblastic bromeliad, Vriesea sanguinolenta, do not concur with the morphological change from atmospheric to tank form","Two distinct morphological forms characterize the ontogeny of many epiphytic bromeliads. Smaller plants exhibit an atmospheric habit, while larger plants form water-impounding tanks. The study of the functional significance of heteroblasty in epiphytes is severely hampered by considerable size-related variation in morphological, anatomical and physiological parameters. To overcome this problem, plants of varying size of both atmospheric and tank form were included in the present study with Vriesea sanguinolenta. The results show that virtually all morphological, anatomical and physiological characteristics vary during ontogeny, but changes were rarely directly related to the step change in gross morphology. Changes were either: (1) gradual from smallest atmospheric to small tank (e.g. leaf divergence angles, reduction in photosystem II efficiency during drought, speed of recovery after drought); (2) there was no change between atmospheric and small tank, but a gradual or step change within the tank form (stomatal density, relationship of leaf N and specific leaf area); or (3) developmental patterns were more complicated with decreases and increases during ontogeny (photosynthetic capacity, carbon isotope ratios, abscisic acid levels during drought). Although the comparisons between ontogenetic phases were always confounded by size differences, a hypothetical small tank plant is expected to suffer higher water loss than a real atmospheric, whereas a hypothetical, large atmospheric plant would show reduced access to resources, such as nutrients, in comparison with the real tank. The present results are consistent with the notion of heteroblasty as an adaptation of early ontogenetic stages to drought, but highlight that size-related variation greatly modifies any difference directly associated with the step change from atmospheric to tank.",TRUE
"Physiological colour change in the elytra of the hercules beetle, Dynastes hercules","Abstract The male of the hercules beetle, Dynastes hercules, is able to change the colour of its elytra from yellowish to black and back again to yellowish within a few minutes. The epicuticle of the elytra is transparent and about 3 Œºm thick. Below it is a yellow spongy layer that is usually about 5 Œºm thick. The cuticle below the yellow sponge is black. When the layer of yellow sponge is air filled it becomes optically heterogeneous, and the light reflected from the elytra is yellow. When the yellow sponge is liquid filled it becomes optically homogeneous, and the black cuticle below is seen. If a beetle that has yellowish elytra is placed in a saturated atmosphere, the elytra become black. When the relative humidity is appreciably reduced, yellow patches begin to appear on the elytra, usually within 30 sec to 2 min. However, if the beetle is kept at a constant relative humidity that previously caused yellowing, it will become black given enough time. Most colour changes observed were clearly in response to changes in the ambient humidity and were not affected when the beetles were kept in the light or in total darkness nor by blackening their eyes or prodding them or exposing them to sounds of different intensities or frequencies. If an elytron is removed from a live beetle, it changes colour in response to changes in relative humidity exactly like the elytron left attached. When a restricted area of the elytra is subjected to a humidity that normally causes blackening and an adjacent area to a humidity that normally causes yellowing, both change colour in the expected way. This local control of colour change seems to preclude hormonal control. It is suggested that the epidermal cells or both the epidermal and blood cells in the elytra are responsible for the hydration and dehydration of the layer of yellow sponge.",TRUE
Physiological Colour Change in the Hercules Beetle,"THE Hercules beetle, Dynastes Hercules L., can change the colour of its elytra‚Äîhorny fore-wings‚Äîfrom black to greenish yellow and back again to black all within a few minutes.

Apart from the reversible migrations of pigment granules in the iris cells, physiological or rapidly reversible colour changes are very rare in insects1‚Äì4. Among beetles, Coptocyclia5, Aspidomorpha, and many other Cassidinae can change the colour of their elytra by varying the amount of water in the cuticle and thereby the thickness of the thin films responsible for the interference colours.",TRUE

"Pinna Temperature in Exercising Jackrabbits, Lepus californicus","Pinna surface temperatures of Lepus californicus were examined radiographically before and after forced exercise (e.g., running at about 6 km/h for 6 min) in an outdoor enclosure. Air temperatures were from ‚àí1.6 to +19.4¬∞C, and radiant sky temperatures were from ‚Äî27 to +22¬∞C. In resting animals, average pinna surface temperature was only 0.3 to 2.5¬∞C above air temperature, and pinna arteries were not evident radiographically. Immediately after exercise, average pinna temperature was often near 30¬∞C and pinna arteries were evident, indicating vasodilation. Cooling of the pinnae to resting temperatures after exercise generally took 15 to 25 min. Calculations indicate that the pinnae can dissipate most of the excess metabolic heat generated during the exercise examined, and it is suggested that the role of the pinnae as dissipators of exercise-induced heat loads should be considered as a factor in the evolution of pinna size.",TRUE

Plant green-island phenotype induced by leaf-miners is mediated by bacterial symbionts,"The life cycles of many organisms are constrained by the seasonality of resources. This is particularly true for leaf-mining herbivorous insects that use deciduous leaves to fuel growth and reproduction even beyond leaf fall. Our results suggest that an intimate association with bacterial endosymbionts might be their way of coping with nutritional constraints to ensure successful development in an otherwise senescent environment. We show that the phytophagous leaf-mining moth Phyllonorycter blancardella (Lepidoptera) relies on bacterial endosymbionts, most likely Wolbachia, to manipulate the physiology of its host plant resulting in the ‚Äògreen-island‚Äô phenotype‚Äîphotosynthetically active green patches in otherwise senescent leaves‚Äîand to increase its fitness. Curing leaf-miners of their symbiotic partner resulted in the absence of green-island formation on leaves, increased compensatory larval feeding and higher insect mortality. Our results suggest that bacteria impact green-island induction through manipulation of cytokinin levels. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that insect bacterial endosymbionts have been associated with plant physiology.",TRUE

Plant-bacteria partnerships for the remediation of hydrocarbon contaminated soils.,"Plant-bacteria partnerships have been extensively studied and applied to improve crop yield. In addition to their application in agriculture, a promising field to exploit plant-bacteria partnerships is the remediation of soil and water polluted with hydrocarbons. Application of effective plant-bacteria partnerships for the remediation of hydrocarbons depend mainly on the presence and metabolic activities of plant associated rhizo- and endophytic bacteria possessing specific genes required for the degradation of hydrocarbon pollutants. Plants and their associated bacteria interact with each other whereby plant supplies the bacteria with a special carbon source that stimulates the bacteria to degrade organic contaminants in the soil. In return, plant associated-bacteria can support their host plant to overcome contaminated-induced stress responses, and improve plant growth and development. In addition, plants further get benefits from their associated-bacteria possessing hydrocarbon-degradation potential, leading to enhanced hydrocarbon mineralization and lowering of both phytotoxicity and evapotranspiration of volatile hydrocarbons. A better understanding of plant-bacteria partnerships could be exploited to enhance the remediation of hydrocarbon contaminated soils in conjunction with sustainable production of non-food crops for biomass and biofuel production.",TRUE
Plasticity in light reactions of photosynthesis for energy production and photoprotection.,"Plant photosynthesis channels some of the most highly reactive intermediates in biology, in a way that captures a large fraction of their energy to power the plant. A viable photosynthetic apparatus must not only be efficient and robust machinery, but also well integrated into the plant's biochemical and physiological networks. This requires flexibility in its responses to the dramatically changing environmental conditions and biochemical demands. First, the output of the energy-storing light reactions must match the demands of plant metabolism. Second, regulation of the antenna must be flexible to allow responses to diverse challenges that could result in excess light capture and subsequent photoinhibition. Evidence is presented for the interplay of two types of mechanistic flexibility, one that modulates the relative sensitivity of antenna down-regulation to electron flow, and the other, which primarily modulates the output ratio of ATP/NADPH, but also contributes to down-regulation.",TRUE
Pointillist structural color in Pollia fruit,"Biological communication by means of structural color has existed for at least 500 million years. Structural color is commonly observed in the animal kingdom, but has been little studied in plants. We present a striking example of multilayer-based strong iridescent coloration in plants, in the fruit of Pollia condensata. The color is caused by Bragg reflection of helicoidally stacked cellulose microfibrils that form multilayers in the cell walls of the epicarp. We demonstrate that animals and plants have convergently evolved multilayer-based photonic structures to generate colors using entirely distinct materials. The bright blue coloration of this fruit is more intense than that of any previously described biological material. Uniquely in nature, the reflected color differs from cell to cell, as the layer thicknesses in the multilayer stack vary, giving the fruit a striking pixelated or pointillist appearance. Because the multilayers form with both helicoidicities, optical characterization reveals that the reflected light from every epidermal cell is polarized circularly either to the left or to the right, a feature that has never previously been observed in a single tissue.",TRUE
Polarization sensitivity in two species of cuttlefish ‚Äì Sepia plangon (Gray 1849) and Sepia mestus (Gray 1849) ‚Äì demonstrated with polarized optomotor stimuli,"SUMMARY The existence of polarization sensitivity (PS), most likely resulting from the orthogonal arrangement of microvilli in photoreceptors, has been proposed in cephalopods for some time, although it has rarely been examined behaviourally. Here, we tested the mourning cuttlefish, Sepia plangon, and the reaper cuttlefish, Sepia mestus, for polarization sensitivity using a large-field optomotor stimulus containing polarization contrast. Polaroid filter drums with stripes producing alternating e-vectors were rotated around free-moving animals. Polarized optomotor responses were displayed, and these responses were similar to those performed in response to a black-and-white, vertically-striped drum, whereas no responses were displayed to a plain polarizing control drum producing just a vertical e-vector. This indicates that the animals are able to see the contrast between adjacent stripes in the polarizing drum. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of functional polarization sensitivity in cuttlefish.",TRUE
Pollen adaptation to ant pollination: a case study from the Proteaceae,"Abstract Background and Aims Ant‚Äìplant associations are widely diverse and distributed throughout the world, leading to antagonistic and/or mutualistic interactions. Ant pollination is a rare mutualistic association and reports of ants as effective pollinators are limited to a few studies. Conospermum (Proteaceae) is an insect-pollinated genus well represented in the south-western Australia biodiversity hotspot, and here we aimed to evaluate the role of ants as pollinators of C. undulatum. Methods Pollen germination after contact with several species of ants and bees was tested for C. undulatum and five co-flowering species for comparison. We then sampled the pollen load of floral visitors of C. undulatum to assess whether ants carried a pollen load sufficient to enable pollination. Lastly, we performed exclusion treatments to assess the relative effect of flying- and non-flying-invertebrate floral visitors on the reproduction of C. undulatum. For this, we measured the seed set under different conditions: ants exclusion, flying-insects exclusion and control. Key Results Pollen of C. undulatum, along with the other Conospermum species, had a germination rate after contact with ants of ~80 % which did not differ from the effect of bees; in contrast, the other plant species tested showed a drop in the germination rate to ~10 % following ant treatments. Although ants were generalist visitors, they carried a pollen load with 68‚Äì86 % of suitable grains. Moreover, ants significantly contributed to the seed set of C. undulatum. Conclusions Our study highlights the complexity of ant‚Äìflower interactions and suggests that generalizations neglecting the importance of ants as pollinators cannot be made. Conospermum undulatum has evolved pollen with resistance to the negative effect of ant secretions on pollen grains, with ants providing effective pollination services to this threatened species.",TRUE
Pollination Efficiency and the Evolution of Specialized Deceptive Pollination Systems,"The ultimate causes of evolution of highly specialized pollination systems are little understood. We investigated the relationship between specialization and pollination efficiency, defined as the proportion of pollinated flowers relative to those that experienced pollen removal, using orchids with different pollination strategies as a model system. Rewarding orchids showed the highest pollination efficiency. Sexually deceptive orchids had comparably high pollination efficiency, but food‚Äêdeceptive orchids had significantly lower efficiency. Values for pollinator sharing (a measure of the degree of generalization in pollination systems) showed the reverse pattern, in that groups with high pollination efficiency had low values of pollinator sharing. Low pollinator sharing may thus be the basis for efficient pollination. Population genetic data indicated that both food‚Äê and sexually deceptive species have higher degrees of among‚Äêpopulation gene flow than do rewarding orchids. Thus, the shift from food to sexual deception may be driven by selection for more efficient pollination, without compromising the high levels of gene flow that are characteristic of deceptive species.",TRUE
Pre-extinction Demographic Stability and Genomic Signatures of Adaptation in the Woolly Rhinoceros,"Ancient DNA has significantly improved our understanding of the evolution and population history of extinct megafauna. However, few studies have used complete ancient genomes to examine species responses to climate change prior to extinction. The woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) was a cold-adapted megaherbivore widely distributed across northern Eurasia during the Late Pleistocene and became extinct approximately 14 thousand years before present (ka BP). While humans and climate change have been proposed as potential causes of extinction [1-3], knowledge is limited on how the woolly rhinoceros was impacted by human arrival and climatic fluctuations [2]. Here, we use one complete nuclear genome and 14 mitogenomes to investigate the demographic history of woolly rhinoceros leading up to its extinction. Unlike other northern megafauna, the effective population size of woolly rhinoceros likely increased at 29.7 ka BP and subsequently remained stable until close to the species' extinction. Analysis of the nuclear genome from a ‚àº18.5-ka-old specimen did not indicate any increased inbreeding or reduced genetic diversity, suggesting that the population size remained steady for more than 13 ka following the arrival of humans [4]. The population contraction leading to extinction of the woolly rhinoceros may have thus been sudden and mostly driven by rapid warming in the B√∏lling-Aller√∏d interstadial. Furthermore, we identify woolly rhinoceros-specific adaptations to arctic climate, similar to those of the woolly mammoth. This study highlights how species respond differently to climatic fluctuations and further illustrates the potential of palaeogenomics to study the evolutionary history of extinct species.",TRUE

Predator-released hydrocarbons repel oviposition by a mosquito.,"Prey species commonly use predator-released kairomones (PRKs) to detect risk of predation, yet the chemical identity of PRKs remains elusive. Chemical identification of PRKs will facilitate the study of predator-prey interactions and the risk of predation, and when the prey are pests, will potentially provide environmentally friendly means of pest control. In temporary pools of the Mediterranean and Middle East, larvae of the mosquito Culiseta longiareolata Macquart are highly vulnerable to the common predatory backswimmer, Notonecta maculata Fabricius. We demonstrate that N. maculata releases two hydrocarbons, n-heneicosane and n-tricosane, which repel ovipositing females of C. longiareolata. In behavioural tests with environmentally relevant chemical concentrations in outdoor mesocosm experiments, the repellent effects of the two compounds were additive at the tested concentrations.",TRUE
PREHENSILE USE OF PERIORAL BRISTLES DURING FEEDING AND ASSOCIATED BEHAVIORS OF THE FLORIDA MANATEE (TRICHECHUS MANATUS LATIROSTRIS),"The use of perioral bristles (modified vibrissae) by 17 captive Florida manatees and approximately 20 wild manatees was analyzed. Captive manatees were fed six species of aquatic vegetation normally eaten in the wild (four freshwater species and two seagrasses). Inanimate objects were placed in the holding tanks with manatees at Lowry Park Zoological Gardens (Tampa, FL) to determine the degree to which perioral bristles were used in exploration and to define the range of manipulative behavior. In addition, behavioral observations were made on the use of perioral bristles during social interactions with conspecifics. Observations were recorded using a Hi8-format video camera. Florida manatees possess an unusually large degree of fine motor control of the snout and perioral bristles. The large and robust perioral bristle fields of the upper lip were used in a prehensile manner during feeding. Bristle use by manatees feeding on submerged vegetation differed from that seen during feeding on floating vegetation. Other behavioral use of the perioral bristles shows variation depending upon the situation encountered. The degree of plasticity of perioral bristle use supports our hypothesis that the vibrissal-muscular complex of the Florida manatee has evolved to increase the efficiency of grazing and browsing on aquatic vegetation and to fully maximize the potential of the manatee as a generalist feeder. The manipulative and sensitive nature of the manatee snout is likely a manifestation of a complex sensory and motor system which has evolved for marine mammal aquatic herbivores living in shallow turbid habitats.",TRUE
Prey Exploits the Auditory Illusions of Eavesdropping Predators,"Mating signals have evolved to attract target receivers, even to the point of exploiting receivers through perceptual manipulation. Signals, however, can also expose signalers to nontarget receivers, including predators and parasites, and thus have also evolved to decrease enemy attraction. Here we show that male tree frogs (Smilisca sila) reduce their attractiveness to eavesdropping enemies (bats and midges) by overlapping their calls at near-perfect synchrony with the calls of neighboring conspecifics. By producing calls that closely follow those of other males, synchronizing S. sila take advantage of an auditory illusion where enemies are more attracted to the leading call. Female S. sila, however, are less susceptible to this illusion. Thus, synchronization among signaling males can result in acoustic crypsis from predators without affecting female attraction. Given the widespread use of conspicuous mating signals and eavesdropping enemies, perceptual exploitation of eavesdroppers is likely a common driver of signal evolution.",TRUE
Propagation and Perception of Bioluminescence: Factors Affecting Counterillumination as a Cryptic Strategy,"Many deep-sea species, particularly crustaceans, cephalopods, and fish, use photophores to illuminate their ventral surfaces and thus disguise their silhouettes from predators viewing them from below. This strategy has several potential limitations, two of which are examined here. First, a predator with acute vision may be able to detect the individual photophores on the ventral surface. Second, a predator may be able to detect any mismatch between the spectrum of the bioluminescence and that of the background light. The first limitation was examined by modeling the perceived images of the counterillumination of the squid Abralia veranyi and the myctophid fish Ceratoscopelus maderensis as a function of the distance and visual acuity of the viewer. The second limitation was addressed by measuring downwelling irradiance under moonlight and starlight and then modeling underwater spectra. Four water types were examined: coastal water at a depth of 5 m and oceanic water at 5, 210, and 800 m. The appearance of the counterillumination was more affected by the visual acuity of the viewer than by the clarity of the water, even at relatively large distances. Species with high visual acuity (0.11¬∞ resolution) were able to distinguish the individual photophores of some counterilluminating signals at distances of several meters, thus breaking the camouflage. Depth and the presence or absence of moonlight strongly affected the spectrum of the background light, particularly near the surface. The increased variability near the surface was partially offset by the higher contrast attenuation at shallow depths, which reduced the sighting distance of mismatches. This research has implications for the study of spatial resolution, contrast sensitivity, and color discrimination in deep-sea visual systems.",TRUE
Propulsive force calculations in swimming frogs I. A momentum‚Äìimpulse approach,"SUMMARY Frogs are animals that are capable of locomotion in two physically different media, aquatic and terrestrial. A comparison of the kinematics of swimming frogs in a previous study revealed a difference in propulsive impulse between jumping and swimming. To explore this difference further, we determined the instantaneous forces during propulsion in swimming using an impulse‚Äìmomentum approach based on DPIV flow data. The force profile obtained was compared with force profiles obtained from drag‚Äìthrust equilibrium of the centre of mass and with the force profiles generated during jumping. The new approach to quantifying the instantaneous forces during swimming was tested and proved to be a valid method for determining the external forces on the feet of swimming frogs. On the kinematic profiles of swimming, leg extension precedes propulsion. This means that it is not only the acceleration of water backwards that provides thrust, but also that the deceleration of water flowing towards the frog as a result of recovery accelerates the centre of mass prior to leg extension. The force profile obtained from the impulse‚Äìmomentum approach exposed an overestimation of drag by 30% in the drag‚Äìthrust calculations. This means that the difference in impulse between jumping and swimming in frogs is even larger than previously stated. The difference between the force profiles, apart from a slightly higher peak force during jumping, lies mainly in a difference in shape. During swimming, maximal force is reached early in the extension phase, 20% into it, while during jumping, peak force is attained at 80% of the extension phase. This difference is caused by a difference in inter-limb coordination.",TRUE
Propulsive force calculations in swimming frogs II. Application of a vortex ring model to DPIV data,"SUMMARY Frogs propel themselves by kicking water backwards using a synchronised extension of their hind limbs and webbed feet. To understand this propulsion process, we quantified the water movements and displacements resulting from swimming in the green frog Rana esculenta, applying digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) to the frog's wake. The wake showed two vortex rings left behind by the two feet. The rings appeared to be elliptic in planform, urging for correction of the observed ring radii. The rings' long and short axes (average ratio 1.75:1) were about the same size as the length and width of the propelling frog foot and the ellipsoid mass of water accelerated with it. Average thrust forces were derived from the vortex rings, assuming all propulsive energy to be compiled in the rings. The calculated average forces (Fav=0.10¬±0.04 N) were in close agreement with our parallel study applying a momentum‚Äìimpulse approach to water displacements during the leg extension phase. We did not find any support for previously assumed propulsion enhancement mechanisms. The feet do not clap together at the end of the power stroke and no `wedge-action' jetting is observed. Each foot accelerates its own water mantle, ending up in a separate vortex ring without interference by the other leg.",TRUE
Protection mechanisms of the iron-plated armor of a deep-sea hydrothermal vent gastropod,"Biological exoskeletons, in particular those with unusually robust and multifunctional properties, hold enormous potential for the development of improved load-bearing and protective engineering materials. Here, we report new materials and mechanical design principles of the iron-plated multilayered structure of the natural armor of Crysomallon squamiferum, a recently discovered gastropod mollusc from the Kairei Indian hydrothermal vent field, which is unlike any other known natural or synthetic engineered armor. We have determined through nanoscale experiments and computational simulations of a predatory attack that the specific combination of different materials, microstructures, interfacial geometries, gradation, and layering are advantageous for penetration resistance, energy dissipation, mitigation of fracture and crack arrest, reduction of back deflections, and resistance to bending and tensile loads.

Protective coloration of European vipers throughout the predation sequence,"Antipredator adaptations in the form of animal coloration are common and often multifunctional. European vipers (genus Vipera) have a characteristic dorsal zigzag pattern, which has been shown to serve as a warning signal to potential predators. At the same time, it has been suggested to decrease detection risk, and to cause a motion dazzle or flicker‚Äìfusion effect during movement. We tested these hypotheses by asking whether (1) the zigzag pattern decreases detection risk and (2) the detection is dependent on the base coloration (grey or brown) or the snake's posture (coiled, basking form or S-shaped, active form). Additionally, (3) we measured the fleeing speed of adders, Vipera berus, and calculated the flicker rate of the zigzag pattern, to see whether it is fast enough to cause a flicker‚Äìfusion effect against predators. Our results show that the zigzag pattern reduced detectability regardless of base coloration or posture of the snake. The brown zigzag morph was detected less often than the grey zigzag morph. The fleeing speed of adders appeared to be fast enough to induce a flicker‚Äìfusion effect for mammalian predators. However, it is unlikely to be fast enough to induce the flicker‚Äìfusion effect for raptors. Our findings highlight that the colour pattern of animals can be multifunctional. The same colour pattern that can decrease detection by predators can also serve as a warning function once detected, and potentially hinder capture during an attack.",TRUE
Protein Oxidation Implicated as the Primary Determinant of Bacterial Radioresistance,"In the hierarchy of cellular targets damaged by ionizing radiation (IR), classical models of radiation toxicity place DNA at the top. Yet, many prokaryotes are killed by doses of IR that cause little DNA damage. Here we have probed the nature of Mn-facilitated IR resistance in Deinococcus radiodurans, which together with other extremely IR-resistant bacteria have high intracellular Mn/Fe concentration ratios compared to IR-sensitive bacteria. For in vitro and in vivo irradiation, we demonstrate a mechanistic link between Mn(II) ions and protection of proteins from oxidative modifications that introduce carbonyl groups. Conditions that inhibited Mn accumulation or Mn redox cycling rendered D. radiodurans radiation sensitive and highly susceptible to protein oxidation. X-ray fluorescence microprobe analysis showed that Mn is globally distributed in D. radiodurans, but Fe is sequestered in a region between dividing cells. For a group of phylogenetically diverse IR-resistant and IR-sensitive wild-type bacteria, our findings support the idea that the degree of resistance is determined by the level of oxidative protein damage caused during irradiation. We present the case that protein, rather than DNA, is the principal target of the biological action of IR in sensitive bacteria, and extreme resistance in Mn-accumulating bacteria is based on protein protection.",TRUE
Psammophily in Namib Desert spiders,"Abstract A community of psammophilous spiders was studied in the central Namib Desert. Of 20 species, 85% were cursorial. Complex setae, claws or keels facilitate digging, sweeping, carrying, and swimming in or walking on sand, while long spigots enable spiders to bind sand with silk when burrowing down to depths with amenable microclimate (10‚Äì120¬†cm). Sand is excavated either by sweeping it up an incline or carrying it vertically up. Other characteristics of dune spiders were large size, polyphagy, low metabolism, longevity, brood care and seasonal foraging and breeding patterns.

Pummelos as Concept Generators for Biomimetically Inspired Low Weight Structures with Excellent Damping Properties,"Natural materials often exhibit excellent mechanical properties. An example of outstanding impact resistance is the pummelo fruit (Citrus maxima) which can drop from heights of 10 m and more without showing significant outer damage. Our data suggest that this impact resistance is due to the hierarchical organization of the fruit peel, called pericarp. The project presented in the current paper aims at transferring structural features from the pummelo pericarp to engineering materials, in our case metal foams, produced by the investment casting process. The transfer necessitates a detailed structural and mechanical analysis of the biological model on the one hand, and the identification and development of adequate materials and processes on the other hand. Based on this analysis, engineering composite foam structures are developed and processed which show enhanced damping and impact properties. The modified investment casting process and the model alloy Bi57Sn43 proved to be excellent candidates to make these bio-inspired structures. Mechanical testing of both the natural and the engineering structures has to consider the necessity to evaluate the impact of the different hierarchical features. Therefore, specimens of largely varying sizes have to be tested and size effects cannot be ignored, especially as the engineering structures might be upscaled in comparison with the natural role model. All in all, the present results are very promising: the basis for a transfer of bio-inspired structural hierarchical levels has been set.",TRUE
Pupil Diameter Tracks Statistical Structure in the Environment to Increase Visual Sensitivity,"Pupil diameter determines how much light hits the retina and, thus, how much information is available for visual processing. This is regulated by a brainstem reflex pathway. Here, we investigate whether this pathway is under the control of internal models about the environment. This would allow adjusting pupil dynamics to environmental statistics to augment information transmission. We present image sequences containing internal temporal structure to humans of either sex and male macaque monkeys. We then measure whether the pupil tracks this temporal structure not only at the rate of luminance variations, but also at the rate of statistics not available from luminance information alone. We find entrainment to environmental statistics in both species. This entrainment directly affects visual processing by increasing sensitivity at the environmentally relevant temporal frequency. Thus, pupil dynamics are matched to the temporal structure of the environment to optimize perception, in line with an active sensing account. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT When light hits the retina, the pupil reflexively constricts. This determines how much light and thus how much information is available for visual processing. We show that the rate at which the pupil constricts and dilates is matched to the temporal structure of our visual environment, although this information is not directly contained in the light variations that usually trigger reflexive pupil constrictions. Adjusting pupil diameter in accordance with environmental regularities optimizes information transmission at ecologically relevant temporal frequencies. We show that this is the case in humans and macaque monkeys, suggesting that the reflex pathways that regulate pupil diameter are under some degree of cognitive control across primate species.",TRUE

Here, we utilize autofluorescence-based confocal laser scanning microscopy to examine the morphology of pygidial gland secretory lobes and collecting ductules in a common Pennsylvanian harpaline species, Harpalus pensylvanicus. The glandular units are composed of type-III exocrine cells which empty into resilin-rich ductules, which themselves lead into a larger resilin-rich collecting duct, and ultimately the pygidial reservoir pump. We also utilize histological staining with toluidine blue and brightfield imaging to provide additional support for the presence of resilin in the collecting duct, as toluidine blue has been shown to stain resilin without metachromasia. We hypothesize that the high resilin content of the collecting ducts might be a widespread key evolutionary adaptation to prevent damage caused by physical and chemical stress generated in pump-containing insect exocrine gland systems.",TRUE
"Pyrolobus fumarii, gen. and sp. nov., represents a novel group of archaea, extending the upper temperature limit for life to 113¬∞C","Abstract A novel, irregular, coccoid-shaped archaeum was isolated from a hydrothermally heated black smoker wall at the TAG site at the Mid Atlantic Ridge (depth 3650 meters). It grew at between 90¬∞C and 113¬∞C (optimum 106¬∞C) and pH 4.0‚Äì6.5 (optimum 5.5) and 1%‚Äì4% salt (optimum 1.7%). The organism was a facultatively aerobic obligate chemolithoautotroph gaining energy by H2-oxidation. Nitrate, S2O32‚Äì, and low concentrations of O2 (up to 0.3% v/v) served as electron acceptors, yielding NH+4, H2S, and H2O as end products, respectively. Growth was inhibited by acetate, pyruvate, glucose, starch, or sulfur. The new isolate was able to form colonies on plates (at 102¬∞C) and to grow at a pressure of 25000 kPa (250 bar). Exponentially growing cultures survived a one-hour autoclaving at 121¬∞C. The GC content was 53mol%. The core lipids consisted of glycerol‚Äìdialkyl glycerol tetraethers and traces of 2,3-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol. The cell wall was composed of a surface layer of tetrameric protein complexes arranged on a p4-lattice (center-to-center distance 18.5nm). By its 16S rRNA sequence, the new isolate belonged to the Pyrodictiaceae. Based on its GC-content, DNA homology, S-layer composition, and metabolism, we describe here a new genus, which we name Pyrolobus (the ""fire lobe""). The type species is Pyrolobus fumarii (type strain 1A; DSM).",TRUE
Quadrupedal locomotor performance in two species of arboreal squirrels: predicting energy savings of gliding,"Gliding allows mammals to exploit canopy habitats of old-growth forests possibly as a means to save energy. To assess costs of quadrupedal locomotion for a gliding arboreal mammal, we used open-flow respirometry and a variable-speed treadmill to measure oxygen consumption and to calculate cost of transport, excess exercise oxygen consumption, and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption for nine northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) and four fox squirrels (Sciurus niger). Our results indicate that oxygen consumption during exercise by flying squirrels was 1.26‚Äì1.65 times higher than predicted based on body mass, and exponentially increased with velocity (from 0.84¬†¬±¬†0.03¬†ml¬†O2¬†kg‚àí1¬†s‚àí1 at 0.40¬†m¬†s‚àí1 to 1.55¬†¬±¬†0.03¬†ml¬†O2¬†kg‚àí1¬†s‚àí1 at 0.67¬†m¬†s‚àí1). Also, cost of transport in flying squirrels increased with velocity, although excess exercise oxygen consumption and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption did not. In contrast, oxygen consumption during exercise for fox squirrels was similar to predicted, varying from 0.51 (¬±0.02) ml¬†O2¬†kg‚àí1¬†s‚àí1 at 0.63¬†m¬†s‚àí1 to 0.54 (¬±0.03) ml¬†O2¬†kg‚àí1¬†s‚àí1 at 1.25¬†m¬†s‚àí1. In addition, the cost of transport for fox squirrels decreased with velocity, while excess exercise oxygen consumption and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption did not. Collectively, these observations suggest that unlike fox squirrels, flying squirrels are poorly adapted to prolonged bouts of quadrupedal locomotion. The evolution of skeletal adaptations to climbing, leaping, and landing and the development of a gliding membrane likely has increased the cost of quadrupedal locomotion by >50% while resulting in energy savings during gliding and reduction in travel time between foraging patches.",TRUE
Quantitative microstructural studies of the armor of the marine threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus),"In this study, a quantitative investigation of the microstructure and composition of field-caught marine Gasterosteus aculeatus (threespine stickleback) armor is presented, which provides useful phylogenetic information and insights into biomechanical function. Micro-computed tomography (microCT) was employed to create full three-dimensional images of the dorsal spines and basal plate, lateral plates, pelvic girdle and spines and to assess structural and compositional properties such as the spatial distribution of thickness (approximately 100-300 microm), the heterogeneous cross-sectional geometry (centrally thickened), plate-to-plate juncture and overlap (approximately 50% of the plate width), and bone mineral density (634-748 HA/cm(3)). The convolution of plate geometry in conjunction with plate-to-plate overlap allows a relatively constant armor thickness to be maintained throughout the assembly, promoting spatially homogeneous protection and thereby avoiding weakness at the armor unit interconnections. Plate-to-plate junctures act to register and join the plates while permitting compliance in sliding and rotation in selected directions. Mercury porosimetry was used to determine the pore size distribution and volume percent porosity of the lateral plates (20-35 vol.%) and spines (10-15 vol.%). SEM and microCT revealed a porous, sandwich-like cross-section beneficial for bending stiffness and strength at minimum weight. Back-scattered electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis were utilized to quantify the weight percent mineral content (58-68%). Scanning electron microscopy and surface profilometry were used to characterize the interior and exterior surface topography (tubercles) of the lateral plates. The results obtained in this study are discussed in the context of mechanical function, performance, fitness, and survivability.",TRUE
Quorum sensing and social networking in the microbial world,"For many years, bacterial cells were considered primarily as selfish individuals, but, in recent years, it has become evident that, far from operating in isolation, they coordinate collective behaviour in response to environmental challenges using sophisticated intercellular communication networks. Cell-to-cell communication between bacteria is mediated by small diffusible signal molecules that trigger changes in gene expression in response to fluctuations in population density. This process, generally referred to as quorum sensing (QS), controls diverse phenotypes in numerous Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Recent advances have revealed that bacteria are not limited to communication within their own species but are capable of ‚Äòlistening in‚Äô and ‚Äòbroadcasting to‚Äô unrelated species to intercept messages and coerce cohabitants into behavioural modifications, either for the good of the population or for the benefit of one species over another. It is also evident that QS is not limited to the bacterial kingdom. The study of two-way intercellular signalling networks between bacteria and both uni- and multicellular eukaryotes as well as between eukaryotes is just beginning to unveil a rich diversity of communication pathways.",TRUE
Radiative Properties of Polar Bear Hair,"The polar bear‚Äôs ability to survive in the harsh arctic night fascinates scientific and lay audiences alike, giving rise to anecdotal and semi-factual stories on the radiative properties of the bear‚Äôs fur which permeate the popular literature, television programs, and textbooks [1‚Äì5]. One of the most interesting radiative properties of polar bear fur is that it is invisible in the infrared region. Some theories have attempted to explain this by claiming that the outer temperature of the fur is the same as that of the environment. However, this explanation is unsatisfactory because surface radiation depends on both the surface temperature and the surface radiative properties [6].Copyright ¬© 2002 by ASME",TRUE
Radular teeth as models for the improvement of industrial cutting devices,"Limpets (Gastropoda) and chitons (Polyplacophora) feed on epi- and endolithic organisms by means of the radula, a specialized feeding apparatus located in the mouth cavity. The radula owes most of its abrasive capability to the presence of numerous mineralized teeth. Here we report on the shape, internal structure, wearing pattern, feeding position, and distribution of hardness and elastic properties of these teeth in an attempt to generate ideas for the innovation of industrial cutting devices. The teeth remain sharp during their entire working-life mainly due to the fact that wearing preferentially occurs along surfaces formed by the internal structure of the tooth. It is shown that shape, internal structure, positioning and material characteristics concertedly function in minimizing the rate at which the teeth wear down and in maintaining optimal cutting behaviour. Implementation of these self-sharpening characteristics into industrial cutting devices is discussed.",TRUE
Rapid increase of vacuolar volume in response to salt stress,"Abstract. Suspension-cultured cells of mangrove [Bruguiera sexangula (Lour.) Poir.] showed a rapid increase in vacuolar volume under salt stress, although there was no change in the cell volume. The rapid increase in the vacuolar volume was an active process, which followed the activation of the tonoplast H+-ATPase and the vacuolar acid phosphatase. The same phenomenon was observed in barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Doriru) root meristematic cells under salt stress but not in pea (Pisum sativum L.). Increases in vacuolar volume could potentially protect the cytoplasm by decreasing the cytoplasmic volume during the initial phases of salt stress.",TRUE
Rapid self-assembly of complex biomolecular architectures during mussel byssus biofabrication,"Protein-based biogenic materials provide important inspiration for the development of high-performance polymers. The fibrous mussel byssus, for instance, exhibits exceptional wet adhesion, abrasion resistance, toughness and self-healing capacity‚Äìproperties that arise from an intricate hierarchical organization formed in minutes from a fluid secretion of over 10 different protein precursors. However, a poor understanding of this dynamic biofabrication process has hindered effective translation of byssus design principles into synthetic materials. Here, we explore mussel byssus assembly in Mytilus edulis using a synergistic combination of histological staining and confocal Raman microspectroscopy, enabling in situ tracking of specific proteins during induced thread formation from soluble precursors to solid fibres. Our findings reveal critical insights into this complex biological manufacturing process, showing that protein precursors spontaneously self-assemble into complex architectures, while maturation proceeds in subsequent regulated steps. Beyond their biological importance, these findings may guide development of advanced materials with biomedical and industrial relevance.",TRUE
Raptorial jaws in the throat help moray eels swallow large prey,"Most bony fishes rely on suction mechanisms to capture and transport prey. Once captured, prey are carried by water movement inside the oral cavity to a second set of jaws in the throat, the pharyngeal jaws, which manipulate the prey and assist in swallowing. Moray eels display much less effective suction-feeding abilities. Given this reduction in a feeding mechanism that is widespread and highly conserved in aquatic vertebrates, it is not known how moray eels swallow large fish and cephalopods. Here we show that the moray eel (Muraena retifera) overcomes reduced suction capacity by launching raptorial pharyngeal jaws out of its throat and into its oral cavity, where the jaws grasp the struggling prey animal and transport it back to the throat and into the oesophagus. This is the first described case of a vertebrate using a second set of jaws to both restrain and transport prey, and is the only alternative to the hydraulic prey transport reported in teleost fishes. The extreme mobility of the moray pharyngeal jaws is made possible by elongation of the muscles that control the jaws, coupled with reduction of adjacent gill-arch structures. The discovery that pharyngeal jaws can reach up from behind the skull to grasp prey in the oral jaws reveals a major innovation that may have contributed to the success of moray eels as apex predators hunting within the complex matrix of coral reefs. This alternative prey transport mode is mechanically similar to the ratcheting mechanisms used in snakes‚Äîa group of terrestrial vertebrates that share striking morphological, behavioural and ecological convergence with moray eels.",TRUE
Reduced immune responsiveness contributes to winter energy conservation in an Arctic bird,"ABSTRACT Animals in seasonal environments must prudently manage energy expenditure to survive the winter. This may be achieved through reductions in the allocation of energy for various purposes (e.g. thermoregulation, locomotion, etc.). We studied whether such trade-offs also include suppression of the innate immune response, by subjecting captive male Svalbard ptarmigan (Lagopus muta hyperborea) to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during exposure to either mild temperature (0¬∞C) or cold snaps (acute exposure to ‚àí20¬∞C), in constant winter darkness when birds were in energy-conserving mode, and in constant daylight in spring. The innate immune response was mostly unaffected by temperature. However, energy expenditure was below baseline when birds were immune challenged in winter, but significantly above baseline in spring. This suggests that the energetic component of the innate immune response was reduced in winter, possibly contributing to energy conservation. Immunological parameters decreased (agglutination, lysis, bacteriostatic capacity) or did not change (haptoglobin/PIT54) after the challenge, and behavioural modifications (anorexia, mass loss) were lengthy (9‚ÄÖdays). While we did not study the mechanisms explaining these weak, or slow, responses, it is tempting to speculate they may reflect the consequences of having evolved in an environment where pathogen transmission rate is presumably low for most of the year. This is an important consideration if climate change and increased exploitation of the Arctic would alter pathogen communities at a pace outwith counter-adaption in wildlife.

Reflectins: the unusual proteins of squid reflective tissues,"A family of unusual proteins is deposited in flat, structural platelets in reflective tissues of the squid Euprymna scolopes. These proteins, which we have named reflectins, are encoded by at least six genes in three subfamilies and have no reported homologs outside of squids. Reflectins possess five repeating domains, which are highly conserved among members of the family. The proteins have a very unusual composition, with four relatively rare residues (tyrosine, methionine, arginine, and tryptophan) comprising approximately 57% of a reflectin, and several common residues (alanine, isoleucine, leucine, and lysine) occurring in none of the family members. These protein-based reflectors in squids provide a marked example of nanofabrication in animal systems.",TRUE
Regulation of brain temperature in winter-acclimatized reindeer under heat stress,"SUMMARY Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) are protected against the Arctic winter cold by thick fur of prime insulating capacity and hence have few avenues of heat loss during work. We have investigated how these animals regulate brain temperature under heavy heat loads. Animals were instrumented for measurements of blood flow, tissue temperatures and respiratory frequency (f) under full anaesthesia, whereas measurements were also made in fully conscious animals while in a climatic chamber or running on a treadmill. At rest, brain temperature (Tbrain) rose from 38.5¬±0.1¬∞C at 10¬∞C to 39.5¬±0.2¬∞C at 50¬∞C, while f increased from √ó7 to √ó250 breaths min‚Äì1, with a change to open-mouth panting (OMP) at Tbrain 39.0¬±0.1¬∞C, and carotid and sublingual arterial flows increased by 160% and 500%, respectively. OMP caused jugular venous and carotid arterial temperatures to drop, presumably owing to a much increased respiratory evaporative heat loss. Angular oculi vein (AOV) flow was negligible until Tbrain reached 38.9¬±0.1¬∞C, but it increased to 0.81 ml min‚Äì1 kg‚Äì1 at Tbrain 39.2¬±0.2¬∞C. Bilateral occlusion of both AOVs induced OMP and a rise in Tbrain and f at Tbrain >38.8¬∞C. We propose that reindeer regulate body and, particularly, brain temperature under heavy heat loads by a combination of panting, at first through the nose, but later, when the heat load and the minute volume requirements increase due to exercise, primarily through the mouth and that they eventually resort to selective brain cooling.",TRUE
"Regulation of water absorption in the frog skins by two vasotocin-dependent water-channel aquaporins, AQP-h2 and AQP-h3.","A new frog aquaporin (AQP) cDNA was cloned from a cDNA library constructed from the ventral skin of the tree frog Hyla japonica. This AQP (Hyla AQP-h2) consisted of 268 amino acid residues with a high homology to mammalian AQP2. The predicted amino acid sequence contained the two conserved Asn-Pro-Ala motifs found in all the major intrinsic protein family members and the putative six transmembrane domains. The sequence also contained a mercurial compound: cysteine, one potential N-glycosylation site at Asn-124, and a putative phosphorylation site recognized by protein kinase A at Ser-262. In a swelling assay using Xenopus oocytes, AQP-h2 facilitated water permeability, especially in response to cAMP. Expression of AQP-h2 mRNA was restricted to several tissues including the ventral skin, kidney, and urinary bladder; but with immunofluorescence staining using an antipeptide antibody (ST-140) against the AQP-h2 protein, immunopositive cells were found only in the ventral skin and urinary bladder. In the ventral pelvic skin, the label for AQP-h2 was localized in the entire plasma membrane of the granular cells beneath the outmost layer of the skin and in the basolateral membrane of the granular cells in this layer. In response to vasotocin, however, the label for AQP-h2 became more intense in the apical membrane in the granular cells of the outermost layer, similar to the case for the earlier studied AQP-h3, which was specifically expressed in the ventral skin. Taken together, these findings suggest that not only AQP-h3, but also AQP-h2 acts as a regulator of the water balance in this frog.",TRUE
Remarkable resilience of teeth,"Tooth enamel is inherently weak, with fracture toughness comparable with glass, yet it is remarkably resilient, surviving millions of functional contacts over a lifetime. We propose a microstructural mechanism of damage resistance, based on observations from ex situ loading of human and sea otter molars (teeth with strikingly similar structural features). Section views of the enamel implicate tufts, hypomineralized crack-like defects at the enamel‚Äìdentin junction, as primary fracture sources. We report a stabilization in the evolution of these defects, by ‚Äústress shielding‚Äù from neighbors, by inhibition of ensuing crack extension from prism interweaving (decussation), and by self-healing. These factors, coupled with the capacity of the tooth configuration to limit the generation of tensile stresses in largely compressive biting, explain how teeth may absorb considerable damage over time without catastrophic failure, an outcome with strong implications concerning the adaptation of animal species to diet.",TRUE
Remora fish suction pad attachment is enhanced by spinule friction,"ABSTRACT The remora fishes are capable of adhering to a wide variety of natural and artificial marine substrates using a dorsal suction pad. The pad is made of serial parallel pectinated lamellae, which are homologous to the dorsal fin elements of other fishes. Small tooth-like projections of mineralized tissue from the dorsal pad lamella, known as spinules, are thought to increase the remora's resistance to slippage and thereby enhance friction to maintain attachment to a moving host. In this work, the geometry of the spinules and host topology as determined by micro-computed tomography and confocal microscope data, respectively, are combined in a friction model to estimate the spinule contribution to shear resistance. Model results are validated with natural and artificially created spinules and compared with previous remora pull-off experiments. It was found that spinule geometry plays an essential role in friction enhancement, especially at short spatial wavelengths in the host surface, and that spinule tip geometry is not correlated with lamellar position. Furthermore, comparisons with pull-off experiments suggest that spinules are primarily responsible for friction enhancement on rough host topologies such as shark skin. Summary: The geometry of remora fish suction disc spinules increases passive friction on rough host surfaces such as shark skin.",TRUE
Remoras pick where they stick on blue whales,"ABSTRACT Animal-borne video recordings from blue whales in the open ocean show that remoras preferentially adhere to specific regions on the surface of the whale. Using empirical and computational fluid dynamics analyses, we show that remora attachment was specific to regions of separating flow and wakes caused by surface features on the whale. Adhesion at these locations offers remoras drag reduction of up to 71‚Äì84% compared with the freestream. Remoras were observed to move freely along the surface of the whale using skimming and sliding behaviors. Skimming provided drag reduction as high as 50‚Äì72% at some locations for some remora sizes, but little to none was available in regions where few to no remoras were observed. Experimental work suggests that the Venturi effect may help remoras stay near the whale while skimming. Understanding the flow environment around a swimming blue whale will inform the placement of biosensor tags to increase attachment time for extended ecological monitoring. Highlighted Article: Analysis of previously undocumented skimming and sliding behaviors used by remoras reveals they preferentially adhere to areas with reduced drag on blue whales.",TRUE
Repeat-induced point mutation in Neurospora crassa causes the highest known mutation rate and mutational burden of any cellular life,"Repeat-induced point (RIP) mutation in Neurospora crassa degrades transposable elements by targeting repeats with C‚ÜíT mutations. Whether RIP affects core genomic sequence in important ways is unknown. By parent-offspring whole genome sequencing, we estimate a mutation rate (3.38‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ 10‚àí6 per bp per generation) that is two orders of magnitude higher than reported for any non-viral organism, with 93‚Äì98% of mutations being RIP-associated. RIP mutations are, however, relatively rare in coding sequence, in part because RIP preferentially attacks GC-poor long duplicates that interact in three dimensional space, while coding sequence duplicates are rare, GC-rich, short, and tend not to interact. Despite this, with over 5 coding sequence mutations per genome per generation, the mutational burden is an order of magnitude higher than the previously highest observed. Unexpectedly, the majority of these coding sequence mutations appear not to be the direct product of RIP being mostly in non-duplicate sequence and predominantly not C‚ÜíT mutations. Nonetheless, RIP-deficient strains have over an order of magnitude fewer coding sequence mutations outside of duplicated domains than RIP-proficient strains. Neurospora crassa has the highest mutation rate and mutational burden of any non-viral life. While the high rate is largely due to the action of RIP, the mutational burden appears to be RIP-associated but not directly caused by RIP.",TRUE
Resilience in social insect infrastructure systems,"Both human and insect societies depend on complex and highly coordinated infrastructure systems, such as communication networks, supply chains and transportation networks. Like human-designed infrastructure systems, those of social insects are regularly subject to disruptions such as natural disasters, blockages or breaks in the transportation network, fluctuations in supply and/or demand, outbreaks of disease and loss of individuals. Unlike human-designed systems, there is no deliberate planning or centralized control system; rather, individual insects make simple decisions based on local information. How do these highly decentralized, leaderless systems deal with disruption? What factors make a social insect system resilient, and which factors lead to its collapse? In this review, we bring together literature on resilience in three key social insect infrastructure systems: transportation networks, supply chains and communication networks. We describe how systems differentially invest in three pathways to resilience: resistance, redirection or reconstruction. We suggest that investment in particular resistance pathways is related to the severity and frequency of disturbance. In the final section, we lay out a prospectus for future research. Human infrastructure networks are rapidly becoming decentralized and interconnected; indeed, more like social insect infrastructures. Human infrastructure management might therefore learn from social insect researchers, who can in turn make use of the mature analytical and simulation tools developed for the study of human infrastructure resilience.",TRUE
Respiration by buried echidnas Tachyglossus aculeatus,"SUMMARY Short-beaked echidnas have an impressive ability to submerge completely into soil or sand and remain there, cryptic, for long periods. This poses questions about how they manage their respiration, cut off from a free flow of gases. We measured the gradient in oxygen partial pressure (PO2) away from the snouts of buried echidnas and oxygen consumption (VÃáO2) in five individuals under similar conditions, in two substrates with different air-filled porosities (fa). A theoretical diffusion model indicated that diffusion alone was insufficient to account for the flux of oxygen required to meet measured rates of VÃáO2. However, it was noticed that echidnas often showed periodic movements of the anterior part of the body, as if such movements were a deliberate effort to flush the tidal air space surrounding their nostrils. These `flushing movements' were subsequently found to temporarily increase the levels of interstitial oxygen in the soil around the head region. Flushing movements were more frequent while VÃáO2 was higher during the burrowing process, and also in substrate with lower fa. We conclude that oxygen supply to buried echidnas is maintained by diffusion through the soil augmented by periodic flushing movements, which ventilate the tidal airspace that surrounds the nostrils.",TRUE

Restoration of tensile strength in bark samples of Ficus benjamina due to coagulation of latex during fast self-healing of fissures.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMSThe functions of plant latex have been discussed for a long time. Today, many studies support a defence mechanism as being its main function. A role as a self-healing mechanism was never attributed to the coagulation of latex. In this study we quantified the contribution of the coagulation of Ficus benjamina (weeping fig) latex to a restoration of the mechanical properties of the bark after external lesions.METHODSTensile tests of F. benjamina bark were conducted either immediately after injury or at various latency times after injury.KEY RESULTSA significant increase in the tensile strength of bark samples until 30 min after injury was found, and this effect could be attributed to the coagulation of plant latex alone. The tensile strength remains nearly constant until several hours or days after injury. Then, very probably due to other mechanisms such as cell growth and cell proliferation, the tensile strength begins to increase slightly again.CONCLUSIONSThe coagulation of latex seals lesions and serves as a quick and effective pre-step of subsequent, more effective, long-lasting self-healing mechanisms such as cell growth and proliferation. Thus, a fast self-healing effect can be included in the list of functions of plant latex.",TRUE
Revisiting a medical case of ‚Äústinging‚Äù in the human oral cavity caused by ingestion of raw squid (Cephalopoda: Teuthida): new data on the functioning of squid‚Äôs spermatophores,"Male squid produce intricate spermatophores that, when transferred to the female, undergo the spermatophoric reaction, a complex process of evagination that leads to the attachment of the spermatangium, that is, the everted spermatophore containing the sperm mass. While this process is still not completely understood, the medical literature includes several reports of ‚Äúoral stinging‚Äù (i.e., punctured wounds in the human oral cavity) following consumption of raw male squid, which contains undischarged spermatophores able to inflict such wounds. Here, we revisit a recent medical report of oral stinging by Shiraki et al. (Pathol Int 61:749‚Äì751, 2011), providing an in-depth reanalysis of their histological biopsies and revealing vital information on the functioning of squid spermatophores. The morphology of the spermatangia attached within the oral cavity is similar to the condition found in spermatangia naturally attached to female squids. The spermatangia were able to superficially puncture the superficial layers of the oral stratified squamous epithelium, and numerous, minute stellate particles from the squid spermatophore were found adhered to the oral epithelium. These findings corroborate previous hypotheses on the functioning of squid spermatophores, namely that spermatophore attachment generally involves tissue scarification, and that stellate particles play a vital role in the attachment process. Moreover, spermatophore attachment is confirmed to be autonomous (i.e., performed by the spermatophore itself) in another squid species (possibly a loliginid), and the results strongly indicate that the attachment mechanism is not dependent upon a specialized epithelium, nor a mate‚Äôs specific chemical stimulus. From the pathological point of view, the best prophylactic measure at present is the removal of the internal organs of the raw squid prior to its consumption.",TRUE
Revisiting synchronous gamete release by fucoid algae in the intertidal zone: fertilization success and beyond?,"In the marine environment, both external fertilization and settlement are critical processes linking adult and early juvenile life-history phases. The success of both processes can be tightly linked in organisms lacking a larval dispersive phase. This review focuses on synchronous gamete release (= spawning) in fucoid algae. These brown macroalgae are important components of temperate intertidal ecosystems in many parts of the world, and achieve synchronous gamete release by integrating various environmental signals. Photosynthesis-dependent sensing of boundary-layer inorganic carbon fluxes, as well as blue light and green light signals, possibly perceived via a chloroplast-located photoreceptor(s), are integrated into pathways that restrict gamete release to periods of low water motion. Avoidance of turbulent and/or high flow conditions in the intertidal zone allows high levels of fertilization success in this group. Temporal patterns and synchrony of spawning in natural populations are reviewed. Most species/populations have a more or less semilunar periodicity, although phase differences occur both between and within species at different geographical locations, raising the possibility that tidal and diurnal cues are more important than semilunar cues in entraining the response. The ecological and evolutionary role(s) of synchronous spawning in the intertidal zone are considered, particularly with regard to hybridization/reproductive isolation in species complexes, and reproductive versus recruitment assurance in the intertidal zone, where synchronous spawning during calm periods may be important for recruitment assurance in addition to fertilization success. Ways in which the roles of spawning synchrony could be tested in closely related species with contrasting mating systems (outcrossing versus selfing) are discussed.",TRUE
Revisiting the organohalogens associated with 1979-samples of Brazilian bees (Eufriesea purpurata).,"Brazilian bees of the species Eufriesea purpurata are known to tolerate very high concentrations of DDT. As reported in the literature, these bees have suffered no harm from as much as 2 mg/bee, which is in the per-cent range of the body weight. In 1979, individuals of E. purpurata were captured as they collected DDT from walls of remote, rural houses in Brazil. Reported herein are quantities and identities of DDT, DDT metabolites, and other organohalogen compounds in four samples of bees stored since 1979. The concentrations of DDT (sum of p,p'-DDT, -DDE, and -DDD) ranged from 23 to 314 microg/bee which is up to twelve fold higher than the LD(50) value of DDT in the honey bee (Apis mellifera) but significantly lower than the no-effect concentration in E. purpurata. Enantioselective determination confirmed the presence of racemic o,p'-DDT in the four individual samples. GC/ECNI-MS investigation resulted in the detection of low amounts (<1 microg/bee) of PCA, lindane, and chlordane. At higher retention times four unknown compounds were detected with a proposed molecular ion at m/z 498, a non-aromatic hydrocarbon backbone along with the presence of eight chlorine substituents. Neither the structure nor the origin of these compounds could be determined. Considering where and when the bees were collected and considering the biology and ecology of the euglossine bees themselves, we propose that the four unknowns are natural products and, as such, are the most highly chlorinated natural compounds yet discovered.",TRUE
"Rheum palaestinum (desert rhubarb), a self-irrigating desert plant","The rare plant Rheum palaestinum (Polygonaceae) is a perennial hemicryptophyte that grows during the rainy winter in desert mountainous areas in Israel and Jordan that receive an average annual rainfall of ca. 75¬†mm. It produces between one and four large round leaves that are tightly attached to the ground and form large rosettes of up to 1¬†m2. These leaves differ markedly from the typical small leaves of most desert plants. Moreover, they have a unique 3D morphology resembling a scaled-down mountainous area with well-developed steep drainage systems, raising the question which selective agents were involved in their evolution. We propose that the large leaves collect rainwater that then infiltrates the soil surrounding the root. We measured the seasonal course of leaf growth, examined the area of wet soil surrounding the root after actual and simulated rain, and modeled the water harvesting capacity using the plant leaf area and the weekly precipitation. We show that even in the slightest rains, water flows above the veins to the leaf‚Äôs base where it irrigates the vertical root. A typical plant harvests more than 4,100¬†cm3 of water per year, and enjoys a water regime of about 427¬†mm/year, equivalent to the water supply in a Mediterranean climate.

Rosette scrub occurrence and fog availability in arid mountains of Mexico,"Abstract.  Large succulent leaf rosettes are a characteristic life form in many deserts. In certain areas they become the dominant life form, creating a vegetation type indicated as rosette scrub. The large number of rosette species suggests a close relationship between form and environment. Rosettes are excellent harvesters of low-intensity rains and fogs. We propose that some rosette-dominated formations of the Mexican mountains, namely the montane rosette scrub, occur in altitudinal belts around mountains where fog is abundant. We sampled four altitudinal gradients in mountains with different flora recording the abundance and richness of plants. At one site, the Tehuac√°n Valley, we also measured the quantity of fog along the gradient, below, above and in the rosette scrub for one year. We found that the abundance and richness of succulent rosette species are strongly associated with altitude, showing maximum values in the well-defined elevational belts where the montane rosette scrub occurs. Other life forms, such as stem succulent cacti or woody shrubs, do not show this mid-elevation pattern. The altitudinal ranges where the montane rosette scrub occurs usually coincide with areas where clouds and fog form. Our micrometeorological measurements indicate that rosette plants growing within a cloud belt can increase their water supply by 10‚Äì100% by harvesting fog. Outside these belts fog harvest is negligible. Desert rosettes constitute one of the most common fog-harvesting growth forms.",TRUE

Rules for Biologically Inspired Adaptive Network Design,"Miniature Transport Engineers In its vegetative phase, the slime mold Physarum polycephalum ‚Äúslimes‚Äù its way through the world seeking food. As it explores, it links previously found food sources with tubular structures. Tero et al. (p. 439) report that if food sources are deposited on a plate in a pattern corresponding in miniature to the positions of the cities that surround Tokyo, the resulting network of Physarum tubules that develops is rather similar in structure to the railroad network that connects the Japanese cities. A model was produced that describes the adaptive network development displayed by the slime mold. This biologically inspired model might provide insight into how to implement properties like resistance of transport systems to local failures into similar human-designed systems. Human municipal transportation engineers might learn design strategies from the lowly slime mold. Transport networks are ubiquitous in both social and biological systems. Robust network performance involves a complex trade-off involving cost, transport efficiency, and fault tolerance. Biological networks have been honed by many cycles of evolutionary selection pressure and are likely to yield reasonable solutions to such combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, they develop without centralized control and may represent a readily scalable solution for growing networks in general. We show that the slime mold Physarum polycephalum forms networks with comparable efficiency, fault tolerance, and cost to those of real-world infrastructure networks‚Äîin this case, the Tokyo rail system. The core mechanisms needed for adaptive network formation can be captured in a biologically inspired mathematical model that may be useful to guide network construction in other domains.",TRUE
Running in ostriches (Struthio camelus): three-dimensional joint axes alignment and joint kinematics,"SUMMARY Although locomotor kinematics in walking and running birds have been examined in studies exploring many biological aspects of bipedalism, these studies have been largely limited to two-dimensional analyses. Incorporating a five-segment, 17 degree-of-freedom (d.f.) kinematic model of the ostrich hind limb developed from anatomical specimens, we quantified the three-dimensional (3-D) joint axis alignment and joint kinematics during running (at ‚àº3.3 m s‚Äì1) in the largest avian biped, the ostrich. Our analysis revealed that the majority of the segment motion during running in the ostrich occurs in flexion/extension. Importantly, however, the alignment of the average flexion/extension helical axes of the knee and ankle are rotated externally to the direction of travel (37¬∞ and 21¬∞, respectively) so that pure flexion and extension at the knee will act to adduct and adbuct the tibiotarsus relative to the plane of movement, and pure flexion and extension at the ankle will act to abduct and adduct the tarsometatarsus relative to the plane of movement. This feature of the limb anatomy appears to provide the major lateral (non-sagittal) displacement of the lower limb necessary for steering the swinging limb clear of the stance limb and replaces what would otherwise require greater adduction/abduction and/or internal/external rotation, allowing for less complex joints, musculoskeletal geometry and neuromuscular control. Significant rotation about the joints' non-flexion/extension axes nevertheless occurs over the running stride. In particular, hip abduction and knee internal/external and varus/valgus motion may further facilitate limb clearance during the swing phase, and substantial non-flexion/extension movement at the knee is also observed during stance. Measurement of 3-D segment and joint motion in birds will be aided by the use of functionally determined axes of rotation rather than assumed axes, proving important when interpreting the biomechanics and motor control of avian bipedalism.",TRUE
Salt allocation during leaf development and leaf fall in mangroves,"Abstract. By taking samples along individual branches and measuring leaf size, thickness and Na+ and K+ concentrations, we have shown in Bruguiera cylindrica, Avicennia rumphiana and Avicennia marina that there are two phases of salt accumulation by leaves. This is confirmed by re-analysis of published data for other species. The first phase is a rapid increase in leaf content as it grows from bud to maturity; the second is a slower but continuous change in quantity in the leaf, via changes in ion concentration and/or in leaf thickening. Leaf thickening must not be overlooked in estimating changes in leaf contents with age. Generally, leaf Na+ content increases significantly, and K+ content falls slightly. Mangrove leaves thus continue as sinks for Na+ throughout their lifetime. At the end of a leaf's life, just before abscission, no burst of salt accumulation has been found. Yellow, senescent leaves do not have higher Na+ than old green ones. We point out that leaf drop involves losing both salt and biomass, not just salt, and hence does not reduce the salt concentration in the plant. We conclude that leaf drop is not a salt excretion mechanism, but is simply the point in time at which the leaf ceases to accumulate salt. Using a simple model, the contribution to salt accumulation of slowly accumulated Na+ by mature leaves has been calculated. For B. cylindrica, the most extensively studied species, 60% of the salt in the leaf is accumulated slowly in the mature phase, thus more than during the initial phase of rapid expansion growth. The limited data suggest that gland-bearing species show smaller changes in mature leaf Na+ content than do gland-less species.",TRUE

Scale-dependent trait correlations in a temperate tree community,"Recent investigations of relationships among plant traits have generated important insights into plant form and function. However, relationships involving leaf area, leaf shape and plant height remain poorly resolved. Previous work has also focused on correlations between average trait values for individual species. It is unclear whether similar relationships occur within species.We searched for novel plant trait correlations by comparing leaf area, leaf circularity, specific leaf area (SLA) and plant height among 16 common woody plant species from a temperate forest in New Zealand. Analyses were conducted both within species (intra-specifically) and among species (inter-specifically) to determine whether trait correlations were scale dependent. Leaf area was unrelated to other leaf traits inter-specifically. However, leaf area declined with plant height and increased with SLA intra- specifically. Leaf circularity decreased with plant height inter-specifically, but increased with plant height intra- specifically. SLA increased with plant height both inter- and intra-specifically. Leaf circularity increased with SLA inter-specifically, but decreased with SLA intra-specifically. Overall results showed that leaf shape, SLA and plant height are interrelated. However, intra-specific relationships often differed substantially from inter-specific rela- tionships, suggesting that the processes shaping relationships between this suite of plant traits are scale-dependent.",TRUE
Scaling and mechanics of carnivoran footpads reveal the principles of footpad design,"In most mammals, footpads are what first strike ground with each stride. Their mechanical properties therefore inevitably affect functioning of the legs; yet interspecific studies of the scaling of locomotor mechanics have all but neglected the feet and their soft tissues. Here we determine how contact area and stiffness of footpads in digitigrade carnivorans scale with body mass in order to show how footpads‚Äô mechanical properties and size covary to maintain their functional integrity. As body mass increases across several orders of magnitude, we find the following: (i) foot contact area does not keep pace with increasing body mass; therefore pressure increases, placing footpad tissue of larger animals potentially at greater risk of damage; (ii) but stiffness of the pads also increases, so the tissues of larger animals must experience less strain; and (iii) total energy stored in hindpads increases slightly more than that in the forepads, allowing additional elastic energy to be returned for greater propulsive efficiency. Moreover, pad stiffness appears to be tuned across the size range to maintain loading regimes in the limbs that are favourable for long-bone remodelling. Thus, the structural properties of footpads, unlike other biological support-structures, scale interspecifically through changes in both geometry and material properties, rather than geometric proportions alone, and do so with consequences for both maintenance and operation of other components of the locomotor system.",TRUE
Seal whiskers detect water movements,"How do pinnipeds orientate themselves under water?

The high sensitivity of this sensory system should allow a seal to gain hydrodynamic information resulting from movements of other aquatic animals, such as prey, predators or conspecifics.",TRUE
Seasonal Adjustment of Solar Heat Gain Independent of Coat Coloration in a Desert Mammal,"Despite the apparent importance of solar radiation as a source of heat for free-living animals, there exists no substantial body of empirical data describing physiological responses to solar radiation under the range of convective conditions likely to occur in nature. We therefore quantified effects of simulated solar radiation and wind on metabolic heat production in the rock squirrel, Spermophilus variegatus. This diurnal mammal inhabits the Sonoran Desert and seasonally replaces its pelage in a fashion in which it retains constant external appearance but incorporates optical and structural changes that are thought to significantly alter heat-transfer properties of the coat. At a given wind speed, the presence of 950 W m‚Åª¬≤ of simulated solar radiation reduces metabolic heat production by 15% (at a wind speed of 4 m s‚Åª¬π) to 37% (at a wind speed of 0.25 m s‚Åª¬π). Independent of effects of irradiance, metabolic heat production significantly increases with wind speed such that as wind speed is increased from 0.25 m s‚Åª¬π to 4.0 m s‚Åª¬π, metabolic heat production is elevated by 66% (sunlight absent) or 88% (sunlight present). Previous analyses demonstrated that when exposed to identical radiative and convective environments rock squirrels with summer pelages accrue solar heat loads 33%-71% lower than those experienced by animals with winter coats. This reduction of solar heat gain during the extremely hot Sonoran Desert summer apparently constitutes a previously unappreciated mode of thermal adaptation by seasonal adjustment of radiative heat gain without changes in the animal's appearance.",TRUE
Secondary metabolites of Bagassa guianensis Aubl. wood: a study of the chemotaxonomy of the Moraceae family,"In order to explain the durability of the Moraceae plant family, phytochemistry of Bagassa guianensis was performed.

SECRETION OF GASES AGAINST HIGH PRESSURES IN THE SWIMBLADDER OF DEEP SEA FISHES II. THE RETE MIRABILE,"1. The structure and dimensions are given for the rete mirabile. It is interpreted as a counter current diffusion exchange mechanism between the afferent and efferent rete.2. This diffusion exchange has been quantitatively evaluated for O2, CO2, and N2. The arrangement makes possible the maintenance of a steep tension gradient within the rete, so that the oxygen loss from the leaving blood can be extremely low.3. Quantitative evaluation of the efficiency of the rete diffusion makes it clear that the limiting equilibrium pressure in the swimbladder could be extremely high, and that the limiting factor lies mainly in the dissociation pressure of the chemical or physical reaction which ultimately splits off the oxygen.4. The nature of the responsible compound and reaction is unknown. The anatomical arrangement of the glandular structure and the rete is suggestive of a cellular secretion of oxygen rather than of a mechanism that splits off oxygen in the blood.5.

Selection of viral variants during persistent infection of insectivorous bat cells with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,"Coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are speculated to have originated in bats. The mechanisms by which these viruses are maintained in individuals or populations of reservoir bats remain an enigma. Mathematical models have predicted long-term persistent infection with low levels of periodic shedding as a likely route for virus maintenance and spillover from bats. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bat cells and MERS coronavirus (CoV) can co-exist in vitro . To test our hypothesis, we established a long-term coronavirus infection model of bat cells that are persistently infected with MERS-CoV. We infected cells from Eptesicus fuscus with MERS-CoV and maintained them in culture for at least 126 days. We characterized the persistently infected cells by detecting virus particles, protein and transcripts. Basal levels of type I interferon in the long-term infected bat cells were higher, relative to uninfected cells, and disrupting the interferon response in persistently infected bat cells increased virus replication. By sequencing the whole genome of MERS-CoV from persistently infected bat cells, we identified that bat cells repeatedly selected for viral variants that contained mutations in the viral open reading frame 5 (ORF5) protein. Furthermore, bat cells that were persistently infected with ŒîORF5 MERS-CoV were resistant to superinfection by wildtype virus, likely due to reduced levels of the virus receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and higher basal levels of interferon in these cells. In summary, our study provides evidence for a model of coronavirus persistence in bats, along with the establishment of a unique persistently infected cell culture model to study MERS-CoV-bat interactions.",TRUE
Self-cleaning in tree frog toe pads; a mechanism for recovering from contamination without the need for grooming,"SUMMARY Tree frogs use adhesive toe pads for climbing on a variety of surfaces. They rely on wet adhesion, which is aided by the secretion of mucus. In nature, the pads will undoubtedly get contaminated regularly through usage, but appear to maintain their stickiness over time. Here, we show in two experiments that the toe pads of White's tree frogs (Litoria caerulea) quickly recover from contamination through a self-cleaning mechanism. We compared adhesive forces prior to and after contamination of (1) the whole animal on a rotatable platform and (2) individual toe pads in restrained frogs mimicking individual steps using a motorised stage. In both cases, the adhesive forces recovered after a few steps but this took significantly longer in single toe pad experiments from restrained frogs, showing that use of the pads increases recovery. We propose that both shear movements and a ‚Äòflushing‚Äô effect of the secreted mucus play an important role in shedding particles/contaminants.",TRUE
Self-organization of river vegetation leads to emergent buffering of river flows and water levels,"Global climate change is expected to impact hydrodynamic conditions in stream ecosystems. There is limited understanding of how stream ecosystems interact and possibly adapt to novel hydrodynamic conditions. Combining mathematical modelling with field data, we demonstrate that bio-physical feedback between plant growth and flow redistribution triggers spatial self-organization of in-channel vegetation that buffers for changed hydrological conditions. The interplay of vegetation growth and hydrodynamics results in a spatial separation of the stream into densely vegetated, low-flow zones divided by unvegetated channels of higher flow velocities. This self-organization process decouples both local flow velocities and water levels from the forcing effect of changing stream discharge. Field data from two lowland, baseflow-dominated streams support model predictions and highlight two important stream-level emergent properties: vegetation controls flow conveyance in fast-flowing channels throughout the annual growth cycle, and this buffering of discharge variations maintains water depths and wetted habitat for the stream community. Our results provide important evidence of how plant-driven self-organization allows stream ecosystems to adapt to changing hydrological conditions, maintaining suitable hydrodynamic conditions to support high biodiversity.",TRUE
Self-organized lane formation and optimized traffic flow in army ants,We show how the movement rules of individual ants on trails can lead to a collective choice of direction and the formation of distinct traffic lanes that minimize congestion. We develop and evaluate the results of a new model with a quantitative study of the behaviour of the army ant Eciton burchelli. Colonies of this species have up to 200 000 foragers and transport more than 3000 prey items per hour over raiding columns that exceed 100 m. It is an ideal species in which to test the predictions of our model because it forms pheromone trails that are densely populated with very swift ants. The model explores the influences of turning rates and local perception on traffic flow. The behaviour of real army ants is such that they occupy the specific region of parameter space in which lanes form and traffic flow is maximized.,TRUE
Self‚ÄêSharpening Mechanism of the Sea Urchin Tooth,"The sea urchin tooth is a mosaic of calcite crystals shaped precisely into plates and fibers, cemented together by a robust calcitic polycrystalline matrix. The tooth is formed continuously at one end, while it grinds and wears at the opposite end, the sharp tip. Remarkably, these teeth enable the sea urchin to scrape and bore holes into rock, yet the teeth remain sharp rather than dull with use. Here we describe the detailed structure of the tooth of the California purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and focus on the self-sharpening mechanism. Using high-resolution X-ray photoelectron emission spectromicroscopy (X-PEEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDX analysis, nanoindentation, and X-ray micro-tomography, we deduce that the sea urchin tooth self-sharpens by fracturing at discontinuities in the material. These are organic layers surrounding plates and fibers that behave as the ‚Äúfault lines‚Äù in the tooth structure, as shown by nanoindentation. Shedding of tooth components at these discontinuities exposes the robust central part of the tooth, aptly termed ‚Äúthe stone‚Äù, which becomes the grinding tip. The precise design and position of the plates and fibers determines the profile of the tooth tip, so as the tooth wears it maintains a tip that is continually renewed and remains sharp. This strategy may be used for the top-down or bottom-up fabrication of lamellar materials, to be used for mechanical functions at the nano- and micrometer scale.",TRUE
Sensitivity to dimethyl sulphide suggests a mechanism for olfactory navigation by seabirds,"Petrels, albatrosses and other procellariiform seabirds have an excellent sense of smell, and routinely navigate over the world's oceans by mechanisms that are not well understood. These birds travel thousands of kilometres to forage on ephemeral prey patches at variable locations, yet they can quickly and efficiently find their way back to their nests on remote islands to provision chicks, even with magnetic senses experimentally disrupted. Over the seemingly featureless ocean environment, local emissions of scents released by phytoplankton reflect bathymetric features such as shelf breaks and seamounts. These features suggest an odour landscape that may provide birds with orientation cues. We have previously shown that concentrated experimental deployments of one such compound, dimethyl sulphide (DMS), attracts procellariiforms at sea, suggesting that some species can use it as a foraging cue. Here we present the first physiological demonstration that an Antarctic seabird can detect DMS at biogenic levels. We further show that birds can use DMS as an orientation cue in a non-foraging context within a concentration range that they might naturally encounter over the ocean.",TRUE
Sensory Trap as the Mechanism of Sexual Selection in a Damselfly Genitalic Trait (Insecta: Calopterygidae),"During copulation, males of some calopterygid damselfly species displace the sperm stored in the spermatheca: the male genital appendages enter into the spermathecal ducts and physically remove sperm. In Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis, the genital appendages are too wide to penetrate the spermathecae, but males use a different mechanism in which the aedeagus stimulates the vaginal sensilla that control spermathecal sperm release. Since these sensilla are used during egg fertilization and oviposition, it was hypothesized that this function evolved before the male stimulatory ability. I investigated this using Hetaerina cruentata, a species whose position in the Calopterygidae phylogeny is more basal than Calopteryx. Given this position and having determined that males of this species are not able to displace sperm of their conspecific females during copulation, it was expected that H. cruentata females would eject sperm when stimulated with the aedeagi of C. haemorrhoidalis but not when stimulated with the aedeagi of their conspecifics. This prediction was confirmed. In order to investigate the widespread nature of this result, some other Calopteryx species‚ÄîCalopteryx xanthostoma and Calopteryx virgo‚Äîwere investigated. The results were similar to those of H. cruentata: conspecific males were unable to stimulate their females, but females ejected sperm when stimulated with C. haemorrhoidalis aedeagi. Morphometric analysis suggests that the mechanistic explanation for the stimulatory ability of C. haemorrhoidalis genitalia is that the aedeagal region that makes contact with the vaginal sensilla is wider in C. haemorrhoidalis than in the other species. These results suggest that the sensory ‚Äúbias‚Äù shown and shared by H. cruentata, Calopteryx splendens, C. virgo, and C. haemorrhoidalis females represents an ancestral condition and that the male stimulatory ability is absent in the evolutionary history of the clade. These pieces of evidence as well as another one presented elsewhere, which indicates that C. haemorrhoidalis males vary in their stimulatory ability, constitute the three criteria for a case of sexual selection via exploitation of a female sensory bias. These results also provide support to the sensory trap hypothesis that indicates that the female bias‚Äîin this case, egg fertilization and oviposition‚Äîevolved in a context different from sexual selection. Considering that the male genital appendages responsible for physically removing spermathecal sperm in other calopterygids are present in C. haemorrhoidalis, I suggest that males were once able to displace spermathecal sperm physically. Such ability may have been later impeded by a reduction in size of the spermathecal ducts. Possibly, one of the latest events in this sequence is the male‚Äôs stimulatory ability. This hypothetical series of events suggests a coevolutionary scenario in which the central actor is the sperm stored in the spermathecae.",TRUE
Serotonin mediates behavioral gregarization underlying swarm formation in desert locusts,"Desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria, show extreme phenotypic plasticity, transforming between a little-seen solitarious phase and the notorious swarming gregarious phase depending on population density. An essential tipping point in the process of swarm formation is the initial switch from strong mutual aversion in solitarious locusts to coherent group formation and greater activity in gregarious locusts. We show here that serotonin, an evolutionarily conserved mediator of neuronal plasticity, is responsible for this behavioral transformation, being both necessary if behavioral gregarization is to occur and sufficient to induce it. Our data demonstrate a neurochemical mechanism linking interactions between individuals to large-scale changes in population structure and the onset of mass migration.",TRUE
"Shape of tropoelastin, the highly extensible protein that controls human tissue elasticity","Elastin enables the reversible deformation of elastic tissues and can withstand decades of repetitive forces. Tropoelastin is the soluble precursor to elastin, the main elastic protein found in mammals. Little is known of the shape and mechanism of assembly of tropoelastin as its unique composition and propensity to self-associate has hampered structural studies. In this study, we solve the nanostructure of full-length and corresponding overlapping fragments of tropoelastin using small angle X-ray and neutron scattering, allowing us to identify discrete regions of the molecule. Tropoelastin is an asymmetric coil, with a protruding foot that encompasses the C-terminal cell interaction motif. We show that individual tropoelastin molecules are highly extensible yet elastic without hysteresis to perform as highly efficient molecular nanosprings. Our findings shed light on how biology uses this single protein to build durable elastic structures that allow for cell attachment to an appended foot. We present a unique model for head-to-tail assembly which allows for the propagation of the molecule‚Äôs asymmetric coil through a stacked spring design.",TRUE
Shaping of a three-dimensional carnivorous trap through modulation of a planar growth mechanism,"Leaves display a remarkable range of forms, from flat sheets with simple outlines to cup-shaped traps. Although much progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of planar leaf development, it is unclear whether similar or distinctive mechanisms underlie shape transformations during development of more complex curved forms. Here, we use 3D imaging and cellular and clonal analysis, combined with computational modelling, to analyse the development of cup-shaped traps of the carnivorous plant Utricularia gibba. We show that the transformation from a near-spherical form at early developmental stages to an oblate spheroid with a straightened ventral midline in the mature form can be accounted for by spatial variations in rates and orientations of growth. Different hypotheses regarding spatiotemporal control predict distinct patterns of cell shape and size, which were tested experimentally by quantifying cellular and clonal anisotropy. We propose that orientations of growth are specified by a proximodistal polarity field, similar to that hypothesised to account for Arabidopsis leaf development, except that in Utricularia, the field propagates through a highly curved tissue sheet. Independent evidence for the polarity field is provided by the orientation of glandular hairs on the inner surface of the trap. Taken together, our results show that morphogenesis of complex 3D leaf shapes can be accounted for by similar mechanisms to those for planar leaves, suggesting that simple modulations of a common growth framework underlie the shaping of a diverse range of morphologies.",TRUE
Shaping the zebrafish myotome by intertissue friction and active stress,"Significance How do tissues self-organize to generate the complex organ shapes observed in vertebrates? Organ formation requires the integration of chemical and mechanical information, yet how this is achieved is poorly understood for most organs. Muscle compartments in zebrafish display a V shape, which is believed to be required for efficient swimming. We investigate how this structure emerges during zebrafish development, combining live imaging and quantitative analysis of cellular movements. We use theoretical modeling to understand how cell differentiation and mechanical interactions between tissues guide the emergence of a specific tissue morphology. Our work reveals how spatially modulating the mechanical environment around and within tissues can lead to complex organ shape formation. Organ formation is an inherently biophysical process, requiring large-scale tissue deformations. Yet, understanding how complex organ shape emerges during development remains a major challenge. During zebrafish embryogenesis, large muscle segments, called myotomes, acquire a characteristic chevron morphology, which is believed to aid swimming. Myotome shape can be altered by perturbing muscle cell differentiation or the interaction between myotomes and surrounding tissues during morphogenesis. To disentangle the mechanisms contributing to shape formation of the myotome, we combine single-cell resolution live imaging with quantitative image analysis and theoretical modeling. We find that, soon after segmentation from the presomitic mesoderm, the future myotome spreads across the underlying tissues. The mechanical coupling between the future myotome and the surrounding tissues appears to spatially vary, effectively resulting in spatially heterogeneous friction. Using a vertex model combined with experimental validation, we show that the interplay of tissue spreading and friction is sufficient to drive the initial phase of chevron shape formation. However, local anisotropic stresses, generated during muscle cell differentiation, are necessary to reach the acute angle of the chevron in wild-type embryos. Finally, tissue plasticity is required for formation and maintenance of the chevron shape, which is mediated by orientated cellular rearrangements. Our work sheds light on how a spatiotemporal sequence of local cellular events can have a nonlocal and irreversible mechanical impact at the tissue scale, leading to robust organ shaping.",TRUE
Shared decision-making drives collective movement in wild baboons,"Baboons follow the pack, not the leader How do groups of animals, including humans, make decisions that affect the entire group? Evidence collected from schooling animals suggests that the process is somewhat democratic, with nearest neighbors and the majority shaping overall collective behavior. In animals with hierarchical social structures such as primates or wolves, however, such democracy may be complicated by dominance. Strandburg-Peshkin et al. monitored all the individuals within a baboon troop continuously over the course of their daily activities. Even within this highly socially structured species, movement decisions emerged via a shared process. Thus, democracy may be an inherent trait of collective behavior. Science, this issue p. 1358 Democracy guides group decisions in baboons, even in the presence of strong social hierarchies. Conflicts of interest about where to go and what to do are a primary challenge of group living. However, it remains unclear how consensus is achieved in stable groups with stratified social relationships. Tracking wild baboons with a high-resolution global positioning system and analyzing their movements relative to one another reveals that a process of shared decision-making governs baboon movement. Rather than preferentially following dominant individuals, baboons are more likely to follow when multiple initiators agree. When conflicts arise over the direction of movement, baboons choose one direction over the other when the angle between them is large, but they compromise if it is not. These results are consistent with models of collective motion, suggesting that democratic collective action emerging from simple rules is widespread, even in complex, socially stratified societies.",TRUE

Shark-skin surfaces for fluid-drag reduction in turbulent flow: a review,"The skin of fast-swimming sharks exhibits riblet structures aligned in the direction of flow that are known to reduce skin friction drag in the turbulent-flow regime. Structures have been fabricated for study and application that replicate and improve upon the natural shape of the shark-skin riblets, providing a maximum drag reduction of nearly 10 per cent. Mechanisms of fluid drag in turbulent flow and riblet-drag reduction theories from experiment and simulation are discussed. A review of riblet-performance studies is given, and optimal riblet geometries are defined. A survey of studies experimenting with riblet-topped shark-scale replicas is also given. A method for selecting optimal riblet dimensions based on fluid-flow characteristics is detailed, and current manufacturing techniques are outlined. Due to the presence of small amounts of mucus on the skin of a shark, it is expected that the localized application of hydrophobic materials will alter the flow field around the riblets in some way beneficial to the goals of increased drag reduction.",TRUE
"Shell growth and chamber formation of aquarium-reared Nautilus pompilius (Mollusca, Cephalopoda) by X-ray analysis.","Observations on the growth rate of aquarium maintained Nautilus pompilius in different developmental stages, i.e. juveniles (shell length about 8.75 cm), late juveniles (approximately 10 cm), and early adolescent (approximately 13.5 cm), indicate that this species is fully grown at an age of 7.3-8 years. The age calculations are based on two different computations: (1) the measurement of the increase of the shell length per day and (2) the formation of new septa in time intervals of 150+/-5 days, as demonstrated by X-ray analyses. After N. pompilius hatches, its shell grows about 139 mm to reach full growth and approximately 28 septa are formed. With an increase of the shell length of 0.052 mm per day, it takes about 2,673 days (7.3 years) to reach maturity. Provided that the process of chamber formation follows an exponential function, these computations result in approximately 2,925 days (8 years) to reach full maturity. Supposing that N. pompilius may live for several years after onset of maturity like Nautilus belauensis, the total life span for this species may exceed 11-12 years.",TRUE
Short-amplitude high-frequency wing strokes determine the aerodynamics of honeybee flight.,"Most insects are thought to fly by creating a leading-edge vortex that remains attached to the wing as it translates through a stroke. In the species examined so far, stroke amplitude is large, and most of the aerodynamic force is produced halfway through a stroke when translation velocities are highest. Here we demonstrate that honeybees use an alternative strategy, hovering with relatively low stroke amplitude (approximately 90 degrees) and high wingbeat frequency (approximately 230 Hz). When measured on a dynamically scaled robot, the kinematics of honeybee wings generate prominent force peaks during the beginning, middle, and end of each stroke, indicating the importance of additional unsteady mechanisms at stroke reversal. When challenged to fly in low-density heliox, bees responded by maintaining nearly constant wingbeat frequency while increasing stroke amplitude by nearly 50%. We examined the aerodynamic consequences of this change in wing motion by using artificial kinematic patterns in which amplitude was systematically increased in 5 degrees increments. To separate the aerodynamic effects of stroke velocity from those due to amplitude, we performed this analysis under both constant frequency and constant velocity conditions. The results indicate that unsteady forces during stroke reversal make a large contribution to net upward force during hovering but play a diminished role as the animal increases stroke amplitude and flight power. We suggest that the peculiar kinematics of bees may reflect either a specialization for increasing load capacity or a physiological limitation of their flight muscles.",TRUE
Should the wind disturbance patterns observed in natural forests be mimicked in planted forests in the British uplands,"Summary Recent developments in UK forestry policy require the adoption of management practices that maintain and improve the biodiversity of managed forests. One approach is to use natural disturbance in unmanaged forests as a template for setting the scale, frequency and pattern of forest operations in managed forests. This review considers the relevance of this approach for conifer plantations in upland Britain. The dynamics of British planted forests are compared with the disturbance dynamics of analogous natural forests with particular reference to disturbance by strong winds. Western hemlock‚ÄêSitka spruce (Tsuga heterophylla‚ÄêPicea sitchensis) forests in the Pacific North-west of North America and particularly South-east Alaska provide the most promising comparison. There are few reports on disturbance in these forests, but the regime includes both gap-phase and stand replacement dynamics due to wind. However, the landscape proportion and pattern of resulting structural types are not well defined. The dynamics of planted forests in Britain are dominated by rotational patch clearfelling which results in regular stand replacement and little possibility of the stands developing beyond the stage of stem exclusion towards old-growth. The pattern and timing of felling is driven by economic and visual amenity considerations rather than by an attempt to mimic natural disturbance patterns. Moreover, the structural complexity and remnant elements (such as deadwood, large trees, vegetation patches) left after large scale disturbance are rarely found after conventional timber harvesting. The authors conclude that natural wind disturbance regimes have potential as a reference point for management in British upland forests but at present are not relevant as a model to mimic explicitly. This is because the biodiversity benefits of adopting a ‚Äònatural‚Äô approach in planted forests are unclear compared with management guided by other criteria such as rarity. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal pattern to be mimicked is not sufficiently well understood. Improved knowledge could inform decisions on the scale and distribution of harvesting across a landscape, and modify silvicultural operations to create and maintain the structures and patterns associated with natural disturbance. However, further research is needed to quantify the spatial and temporal characteristics of wind disturbance in upland forests in Britain and in natural forests elsewhere.",TRUE
Sidewinding with minimal slip: Snake and robot ascent of sandy slopes,"Limbless organisms such as snakes can navigate nearly all terrain. In particular, desert-dwelling sidewinder rattlesnakes (Crotalus cerastes) operate effectively on inclined granular media (such as sand dunes) that induce failure in field-tested limbless robots through slipping and pitching. Our laboratory experiments reveal that as granular incline angle increases, sidewinder rattlesnakes increase the length of their body in contact with the sand. Implementing this strategy in a physical robot model of the snake enables the device to ascend sandy slopes close to the angle of maximum slope stability. Plate drag experiments demonstrate that granular yield stresses decrease with increasing incline angle. Together, these three approaches demonstrate how sidewinding with contact-length control mitigates failure on granular media. Robots based on sidewinder rattlesnakes are used to understand motion on sloped granular terrain. [Also see Perspective by Socha] What's that coming over the hill‚Äîis it a robot? Crossing a slope can be difficult, particularly if it is made of sand. Sidewinder rattlesnakes manage to climb sandy hills by adjusting the length of their body in contact with the sand. Marvi et al. designed robots based on this idea to determine what affects climbing ability on sandy slopes (see the Perspective by Socha). Based on the behavior of the robots, the authors performed further animal studies, and used an iterative approach to improve the robots' capabilities and to better understand animal motion.

Signatures of functional constraint at aye-aye opsin genes: the potential of adaptive color vision in a nocturnal primate.,"While color vision perception is thought to be adaptively correlated with foraging efficiency for diurnal mammals, those that forage exclusively at night may not need color vision nor have the capacity for it. Indeed, although the basic condition for mammals is dichromacy, diverse nocturnal mammals have only monochromatic vision, resulting from functional loss of the short-wavelength sensitive opsin gene. However, many nocturnal primates maintain intact two opsin genes and thus have dichromatic capacity. The evolutionary significance of this surprising observation has not yet been elucidated. We used a molecular population genetics approach to test evolutionary hypotheses for the two intact opsin genes of the fully nocturnal aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), a highly unusual and endangered Madagascar primate. No evidence of gene degradation in either opsin gene was observed for any of 8 aye-aye individuals examined. Furthermore, levels of nucleotide diversity for opsin gene functional sites were lower than those for 15 neutrally evolving intergenic regions (>25 kb in total), which is consistent with a history of purifying selection on aye-aye opsin genes. The most likely explanation for these findings is that dichromacy is advantageous for aye-ayes despite their nocturnal activity pattern. We speculate that dichromatic nocturnal primates may be able to perceive color while foraging under moonlight conditions, and suggest that behavioral and ecological comparisons among dichromatic and monochromatic nocturnal primates will help to elucidate the specific activities for which color vision perception is advantageous.",TRUE
Simulating ozone detoxification in the leaf apoplast through the direct reaction with ascorbate,"This paper presents a mathematical model which enables the semi-quantification of ozone (O3) detoxification, based upon the direct reaction of the pollutant with ascorbate (ASC) located in the aqueous matrix associated with the cell wall (i.e. the apoplast). The model describes the uptake of ozone into the leaf and its direct reaction with ASC, taking into consideration the regeneration of dehydroascorbic acid in the cytosol, the rate of replenishment of cell wall ASC and the distribution of ASC between sub-cellular compartments based upon the permeability of biomembranes to the neutral species, ascorbic acid and the pH of various sub-cellular compartments. The importance of various physico-chemical characteristics (e.g. stomatal conductance, mesophyll cell wall thickness and tortuosity, chloroplast volume, apoplast pH, ASC:O3 reaction stoichiometry) in mediating the flux of ozone to the plasmalemma is analysed. Model simulations, supported by experimental observations, suggest that the ASC concentration in the leaf apoplast is high enough to scavenge a significant proportion of the O3 taken up into the leaf interior, under environmentally relevant conditions. However, there is considerable variation between taxa in the potential degree of protection afforded by apoplastic ASC, emphasizing the need for an improved understanding of the reaction chemistry of O3 in the cell wall.",TRUE
Skeletal development in sloths and the evolution of mammalian vertebral patterning,"Mammals show a very low level of variation in vertebral count, particularly in the neck. Phenotypes exhibited at various stages during the development of the axial skeleton may play a key role in testing mechanisms recently proposed to explain this conservatism. Here, we provide osteogenetic data that identify developmental criteria with which to recognize cervical vs. noncervical vertebrae in mammals. Except for sloths, all mammals show the late ossification of the caudal-most centra in the neck after other centra and neural arches. In sloths with 8‚Äì10 ribless neck vertebrae, the caudal-most neck centra ossify early, matching the pattern observed in cranial thoracic vertebrae of other mammals. Accordingly, we interpret the ribless neck vertebrae of three-toed sloths caudal to V7 as thoracic based on our developmental criterion. Applied to the unusual vertebral phenotype of long-necked sloths, these data support the interpretation that elements of the axial skeleton with origins from distinct mesodermal tissues have repatterned over the course of evolution.",TRUE
Skin barrier structure and function: the single gel phase model,"A new model for the structure and function of the mammalian skin barrier is postulated. It is proposed that the skin barrier, i.e., the intercellular lipid within the stratum corneum, exists as a single and coherent lamellar gel phase. This membrane structure is stabilized by the very particular lipid composition and lipid chain length distributions of the stratum corneum intercellular space and has virtually no phase boundaries. The intact, i.e., unperturbed, single and coherent lamellar gel phase is proposed to be mainly located at the lower half of stratum corneum. Further up, crystalline segregation and phase separation may occur as a result of the desquamation process. The single gel phase model differs significantly from earlier models in that it predicts that no phase separation, neither between liquid crystalline and gel phases nor between different crystalline phases with hexagonal and orthorhombic chain packing, respectively, is present in the unperturbed barrier structure. The new skin barrier model may explain: (i) the measured water permeability of stratum corneum; (ii) the particular lipid composition of the stratum corneum intercellular space; (iii) the absence of swelling of the stratum corneum intercellular lipid matrix upon hydration; and (iv) the simultaneous presence of hexagonal and orthorhombic hydrocarbon chain packing of the stratum corneum intercellular lipid matrix at physiologic temperatures. Further, the new model is consistent with skin barrier formation according to the membrane folding model of Norl√©n (2001). This new theoretical model could fully account for the extraordinary barrier capacity of mammalian skin and is hereafter referred to as the single gel phase model.",TRUE
Slippery surfaces of pitcher plants: Nepenthes wax crystals minimize insect attachment via microscopic surface roughness,"SUMMARY Pitcher plants of the genus Nepenthes efficiently trap and retain insect prey in highly specialized leaves. Besides a slippery peristome which inhibits adhesion of insects they employ epicuticular wax crystals on the inner walls of the conductive zone of the pitchers to hamper insect attachment by adhesive devices. It has been proposed that the detachment of individual crystals and the resulting contamination of adhesive organs is responsible for capturing insects. However, our results provide evidence in favour of a different mechanism, mainly based on the stability and the roughness of the waxy surface. First, we were unable to detect a large quantity of crystal fragments on the pads of insects detached from mature pitcher surfaces of Nepenthes alata. Second, investigation of the pitcher surface by focused ion beam treatment showed that the wax crystals form a compact 3D structure. Third, atomic force microscopy of the platelet-shaped crystals revealed that the crystals are mechanically stable, rendering crystal detachment by insect pads unlikely. Fourth, the surface profile parameters of the wax layer showed striking similarities to those of polishing paper with low grain size. By measuring friction forces of insects on this artificial surface we demonstrate that microscopic roughness alone is sufficient to minimize insect attachment. A theoretical model shows that surface roughness within a certain length scale will prevent adhesion by being too rough for adhesive pads but not rough enough for claws.",TRUE
Small groups and long memories promote cooperation,"Complex social behaviors lie at the heart of many of the challenges facing evolutionary biology, sociology, economics, and beyond. For evolutionary biologists the question is often how group behaviors such as collective action, or decision making that accounts for memories of past experience, can emerge and persist in an evolving system. Evolutionary game theory provides a framework for formalizing these questions and admitting them to rigorous study. Here we develop such a framework to study the evolution of sustained collective action in multi-player public-goods games, in which players have arbitrarily long memories of prior rounds of play and can react to their experience in an arbitrary way. We construct a coordinate system for memory-m strategies in iterated n-player games that permits us to characterize all cooperative strategies that resist invasion by any mutant strategy, and stabilize cooperative behavior. We show that, especially when groups are small, longer-memory strategies make cooperation easier to evolve, by increasing the number of ways to stabilize cooperation. We also explore the co-evolution of behavior and memory. We find that even when memory has a cost, longer-memory strategies often evolve, which in turn drives the evolution of cooperation, even when the benefits for cooperation are low.",TRUE
Smart Swarms of Bacteria-Inspired Agents with Performance Adaptable Interactions,"Collective navigation and swarming have been studied in animal groups, such as fish schools, bird flocks, bacteria, and slime molds. Computer modeling has shown that collective behavior of simple agents can result from simple interactions between the agents, which include short range repulsion, intermediate range alignment, and long range attraction. Here we study collective navigation of bacteria-inspired smart agents in complex terrains, with adaptive interactions that depend on performance. More specifically, each agent adjusts its interactions with the other agents according to its local environment ‚Äì by decreasing the peers' influence while navigating in a beneficial direction, and increasing it otherwise. We show that inclusion of such performance dependent adaptable interactions significantly improves the collective swarming performance, leading to highly efficient navigation, especially in complex terrains. Notably, to afford such adaptable interactions, each modeled agent requires only simple computational capabilities with short-term memory, which can easily be implemented in simple swarming robots.",TRUE
Smart water channelling through dual wettability by leaves of the bamboo Phyllostachys aurea.,"The young leaves of the bamboo plant, Phyllostachys aurea, exhibit a distinct dual wetting behaviour on their adaxial surface. Contact angle analysis, variable pressure (environmental) scanning electron microscopy, gas chromatography, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy have shown that the epicuticular wax morphology/topography and the surface distribution of chemical species underpin this water-channelling behaviour. Envisaged bioinspired applications include fog and dew harvesting in water-scarce regions of the world.",TRUE
Snake velvet black: Hierarchical micro- and nanostructure enhances dark colouration in Bitis rhinoceros,"The West African Gaboon viper (Bitis rhinoceros) is a master of camouflage due to its colouration pattern. Its skin is geometrically patterned and features black spots that purport an exceptional spatial depth due to their velvety surface texture. Our study shades light on micromorphology, optical characteristics and principles behind such a velvet black appearance. We revealed a unique hierarchical pattern of leaf-like microstructures striated with nanoridges on the snake scales that coincides with the distribution of black colouration. Velvet black sites demonstrate four times lower reflectance and higher absorbance than other scales in the UV ‚Äì near IR spectral range. The combination of surface structures impeding reflectance and absorbing dark pigments, deposited in the skin material, provides reflecting less than 11% of the light reflected by a polytetrafluoroethylene diffuse reflectance standard in any direction. A view-angle independent black structural colour in snakes is reported here for the first time.",TRUE
Snapping mechanics of the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula),"Significance The rapid closure of the carnivorous Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) snap-trap incorporates snap-buckling instability as a speed boost. The trap actuation principles required to overcome the involved energy barrier, as determined by the double-lobe curvature, have remained speculative until now. Here we used 3D digital image correlation for the analysis of trap deformation during closure for both the outer and the inner trap surfaces. Accompanying biomechanical and physiological experiments revealed that successful snapping relies on full trap hydration. In combination with FEM simulations elucidating the mechanical contribution of the various trap tissues to the motion, we show that the trapping mechanics incorporate an elaborate interplay between swelling/shrinking processes of the various tissue layers and the release of trap-internal prestress. The mechanical principles for fast snapping in the iconic Venus flytrap are not yet fully understood. In this study, we obtained time-resolved strain distributions via three-dimensional digital image correlation (DIC) for the outer and inner trap-lobe surfaces throughout the closing motion. In combination with finite element models, the various possible contributions of the trap tissue layers were investigated with respect to the trap‚Äôs movement behavior and the amount of strain required for snapping. Supported by in vivo experiments, we show that full trap turgescence is a mechanical‚Äìphysiological prerequisite for successful (fast and geometrically correct) snapping, driven by differential tissue changes (swelling, shrinking, or no contribution). These are probably the result of the previous accumulation of internal hydrostatic pressure (prestress), which is released after trap triggering. Our research leads to an in-depth mechanical understanding of a complex plant movement incorporating various actuation principles.",TRUE
Sneeze to leave: African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) use variable quorum thresholds facilitated by sneezes in collective decisions,"In despotically driven animal societies, one or a few individuals tend to have a disproportionate influence on group decision-making and actions. However, global communication allows each group member to assess the relative strength of preferences for different options among their group-mates. Here, we investigate collective decisions by free-ranging African wild dog packs in Botswana. African wild dogs exhibit dominant-directed group living and take part in stereotyped social rallies: high energy greeting ceremonies that occur before collective movements. Not all rallies result in collective movements, for reasons that are not well understood. We show that the probability of rally success (i.e. group departure) is predicted by a minimum number of audible rapid nasal exhalations (sneezes), within the rally. Moreover, the number of sneezes needed for the group to depart (i.e. the quorum) was reduced whenever dominant individuals initiated rallies, suggesting that dominant participation increases the likelihood of a rally's success, but is not a prerequisite. As such, the ‚Äòwill of the group‚Äô may override dominant preferences when the consensus of subordinates is sufficiently great. Our findings illustrate how specific behavioural mechanisms (here, sneezing) allow for negotiation (in effect, voting) that shapes decision-making in a wild, socially complex animal society.",TRUE

Soft Matter Mechanics and the Mechanisms Underpinning the Infrared Vision of Snakes,"Summary Pit-bearing snakes (vipers, pythons, and boas) have the extraordinary ability to ‚Äúsee‚Äù and accurately locate their prey and predators in total darkness. These animals use the infrared radiation emanating from objects that are warmer relative to the background environment to form a thermal image. Although enormous progress has been made to identify the key physiological features that enable the infrared vision of these snakes and a few other animals, the precise thermoelectric transduction mechanism that mediates the conversion of infrared heat to processable electrical signals has remained elusive. In this work, we quantitatively outline how cells in the snake's pit membrane organ act as apparent pyroelectric materials and convert infrared radiation into electrical signals. Despite the exceptional simplicity of our proposed mechanism and model, we are able to explain many central experimental results pertaining to the transduction process.",TRUE

Solar-powered ventilation of African termite mounds,"ABSTRACT How termite mounds function to facilitate climate control is still only partially understood. Recent experimental evidence in the mounds of a single species, the south Asian termite Odontotermes obesus, suggests that the daily oscillations of radiant heating associated with diurnal insolation patterns drive convective flow within them. How general this mechanism is remains unknown. To probe this, we consider the mounds of the African termite Macrotermes michaelseni, which thrives in a very different environment. By directly measuring air velocities and temperatures within the mound, we see that the overall mechanisms and patterns involved are similar to that in the south Asian species. However, there are also some notable differences between the physiology of these mounds associated with the temporal variations in radiant heating patterns and CO2 dynamics. Because of the difference between direct radiant heating driven by the position of the sun in African conditions, and the more shaded south Asian environments, we see changes in the convective flows in the two types of mounds. Furthermore, we also see that the south Asian mounds show a significant overturning of stratified gases, once a day, while the African mounds have a relatively uniform concentration of CO2. Overall, our observations show that despite these differences, termite architectures can harness periodic solar heating to drive ventilation inside them in very different environments, functioning as an external lung, with clear implications for human engineering. Highlighted Article: Termite mounds harness oscillatory solar heating to drive internal ventilation of metabolic gases, functioning as an external lung for the colony.

Solutes determine the temperature windows for microbial survival and growth,"Microbial cells, and ultimately the Earth's biosphere, function within a narrow range of physicochemical conditions. For the majority of ecosystems, productivity is cold-limited, and it is microbes that represent the failure point. This study was carried out to determine if naturally occurring solutes can extend the temperature windows for activity of microorganisms. We found that substances known to disorder cellular macromolecules (chaotropes) did expand microbial growth windows, fungi preferentially accumulated chaotropic metabolites at low temperature, and chemical activities of solutes determined microbial survival at extremes of temperature as well as pressure. This information can enhance the precision of models used to predict if extraterrestrial and other hostile environments are able to support life; furthermore, chaotropes may be used to extend the growth windows for key microbes, such as saprotrophs, in cold ecosystems and manmade biomes.",TRUE

Soy and Arabidopsis receptor-like kinases respond to polysaccharide signals from Spodoptera species and mediate herbivore resistance,"Plants respond to herbivory by perceiving herbivore danger signal(s) (HDS(s)), including ‚Äúelicitors‚Äù, that are present in herbivores‚Äô oral secretions (OS) and act to induce defense responses. However, little is known about HDS-specific molecules and intracellular signaling. Here we explored soybean receptor-like kinases (RLKs) as candidates that might mediate HDS-associated RLKs‚Äô (HAKs‚Äô) actions in leaves in response to OS extracted from larvae of a generalist herbivore, Spodoptera litura. Fractionation of OS yielded FrŒ±, which consisted of polysaccharides. The GmHAKs composed of their respective homomultimers scarcely interacted with FrŒ±. Moreover, Arabidopsis HAK1 homomultimers interacted with cytoplasmic signaling molecule PBL27, resulting in herbivory resistance, in an ethylene-dependent manner. Altogether, our findings suggest that HAKs are herbivore-specific RLKs mediating HDS-transmitting, intracellular signaling through interaction with PBL27 and the subsequent ethylene signaling for plant defense responses in host plants. Uemura et al. study the mechanism of herbivore resistance in soybean and Arabidopsis. They show that receptor-like kinases (HAK1/2) respond to a polysaccharide in the oral secretions of Spodoptera litura and then interact with PBL27, resulting in an ethylene-dependent herbivore resistance.",TRUE
Spatial mapping of polymicrobial communities reveals a precise biogeography associated with human dental caries,"Significance Dental caries remains an unresolved public health problem. The etiology is poorly understood, as the oral cavity harbors diverse communities of microorganisms. Using multiple imaging modalities on human teeth from patients with caries, we discovered a microbial community precisely arranged in a corona-like architecture. Moreover, this organization is mediated by the pathogen Streptococcus mutans through production of an extracellular scaffold that directs positioning of other oral microbes. We developed a methodology to quantify the spatial structure of microbial communities at the micron scale and found a precise spatial patterning of bacteria associated with localized caries onset. These findings are relevant as we approach the post-microbiome era, whereby quantifying the community structural organization may be essential for understanding microbiome function. Tooth decay (dental caries) is a widespread human disease caused by microbial biofilms. Streptococcus mutans, a biofilm-former, has been consistently associated with severe childhood caries; however, how this bacterium is spatially organized with other microorganisms in the oral cavity to promote disease remains unknown. Using intact biofilms formed on teeth of toddlers affected by caries, we discovered a unique 3D rotund-shaped architecture composed of multiple species precisely arranged in a corona-like structure with an inner core of S. mutans encompassed by outer layers of other bacteria. This architecture creates localized regions of acidic pH and acute enamel demineralization (caries) in a mixed-species biofilm model on human teeth, suggesting this highly ordered community as the causative agent. Notably, the construction of this architecture was found to be an active process initiated by production of an extracellular scaffold by S. mutans that assembles the corona cell arrangement, encapsulating the pathogen core. In addition, this spatial patterning creates a protective barrier against antimicrobials while increasing bacterial acid fitness associated with the disease-causing state. Our data reveal a precise biogeography in a polymicrobial community associated with human caries that can modulate the pathogen positioning and virulence potential in situ, indicating that micron-scale spatial structure of the microbiome may mediate the function and outcome of host‚Äìpathogen interactions.",TRUE

Spatial vision in the echinoid genus Echinometra,"SUMMARY Although eyes are generally considered necessary for image resolution, a diffuse photoreceptive system with directional sensitivity may also have this ability. Two species of the echinoid genus Echinometra were tested for spatial vision by examining their ability to locate and move towards targets of different sizes. The echinoids were significantly oriented (P<0.0001) towards a target with an angular width of 33¬∞ (0.3 sr) but were not oriented to targets with angular widths of 26¬∞ and 16¬∞. This ability is probably due to the blocking of off-angle light by the spines, which have approximately the correct spacing for the observed resolution. Spatial vision is advantageous for echinoids of this genus because they leave and return to small dark shelters. This first demonstration of spatial vision in an echinoderm sheds further light on the complex optical structures and photobehaviors found in this phylum.",TRUE
Spatial vision in the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Echinoidea),"SUMMARY Recent evidence that echinoids of the genus Echinometra have moderate visual acuity that appears to be mediated by their spines screening off-axis light suggests that the urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, with its higher spine density, may have even more acute spatial vision. We analyzed the movements of 39 specimens of S. purpuratus after they were placed in the center of a featureless tank containing a round, black target that had an angular diameter of 6.5 deg. or 10 deg. (solid angles of 0.01 sr and 0.024 sr, respectively). An average orientation vector for each urchin was determined by testing the animal four times, with the target placed successively at bearings of 0 deg., 90 deg., 180 deg. and 270 deg. (relative to magnetic east). The urchins showed no significant unimodal or axial orientation relative to any non-target feature of the environment or relative to the changing position of the 6.5 deg. target. However, the urchins were strongly axially oriented relative to the changing position of the 10 deg. target (mean axis from ‚Äì1 to 179 deg.; 95% confidence interval ¬± 12 deg.; P<0.001, Moore's non-parametric Hotelling's test), with 10 of the 20 urchins tested against that target choosing an average bearing within 10 deg. of either the target center or its opposite direction (two would be expected by chance). In addition, the average length of the 20 target-normalized bearings for the 10 deg. target (each the vector sum of the bearings for the four trials) were far higher than would be expected by chance (P<10‚àí10; Monte Carlo simulation), showing that each urchin, whether it moved towards or away from the target, did so with high consistency. These results strongly suggest that S. purpuratus detected the 10 deg. target, responding either by approaching it or fleeing it. Given that the urchins did not appear to respond to the 6.5 deg. target, it is likely that the 10 deg. target was close to the minimum detectable size for this species. Interestingly, measurements of the spine density of the regions of the test that faced horizontally predicted a similar visual resolution (8.3¬±0.5 deg. for the interambulacrum and 11¬±0.54 deg. for the ambulacrum). The function of this relatively low, but functional, acuity ‚Äì on par with that of the chambered Nautilus and the horseshoe crab ‚Äì is unclear but, given the bimodal response, is likely to be related to both shelter seeking and predator avoidance.",TRUE
Species richness and redundancy promote persistence of exploited mutualisms in yeast,"Species richness maintains mutualisms Mutualistic communities of species that benefit each other are ubiquitous in ecosystems and are important for ecosystem functioning. However, the relationship between the persistence of mutualisms and species richness has remained unclear. Vidal et al. used a synthetic mutualism in brewer's yeast to experimentally test whether species richness buffers mutualistic communities against exploitation by species that do not provide benefits in return. They showed that richer mutualist communities survive exploitation more often than pairwise mutualisms and that higher species richness and functional redundancy allow mutualist communities to persist in the presence of exploiters. These results provide experimental support for the hypothesis that species richness is necessary for the function and maintenance of mutualistic communities. Science, this issue p. 346 Experiments with yeast show that species richness buffers against loss of mutualistic interactions in ecological communities. Mutualisms, or reciprocally beneficial interspecific interactions, constitute the foundation of many ecological communities and agricultural systems. Mutualisms come in different forms, from pairwise interactions to extremely diverse communities, and they are continually challenged with exploitation by nonmutualistic community members (exploiters). Thus, understanding how mutualisms persist remains an essential question in ecology. Theory suggests that high species richness and functional redundancy could promote mutualism persistence in complex mutualistic communities. Using a yeast system (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), we experimentally show that communities with the greatest mutualist richness and functional redundancy are nearly two times more likely to survive exploitation than are simple communities. Persistence increased because diverse communities were better able to mitigate the negative effects of competition with exploiters. Thus, large mutualistic networks may be inherently buffered from exploitation.",TRUE
Species-Specific Evolution of Ebola Virus during Replication in Human and Bat Cells," Summary  Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a severe, often fatal disease in humans and nonhuman primates. Within the past decade, EBOV has caused two large and difficult-to-control outbreaks, one of which recently ended in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Bats are the likely reservoir of EBOV, but little is known of their relationship with the virus. We perform serial passages of EBOV in human and bat cells and use circular sequencing to compare the short-term evolution of the virus. Virus populations passaged in bat cells have sequence markers indicative of host RNA editing enzyme activity, including evidence for ADAR editing of the EBOV glycoprotein. Multiple regions in the EBOV genome appear to have undergone adaptive evolution when passaged in bat and human cells. Individual mutated viruses are rescued and characterized. Our results provide insight into the host species-specific evolution of EBOV and highlight the adaptive flexibility of the virus. ",TRUE
Sperm head abnormalities are more frequent in songbirds with more helical sperm: A possible trade‚Äêoff in sperm evolution,"Sperm morphology varies enormously across the animal kingdom. Whilst knowledge of the factors that drive the evolution of interspecific variation in sperm morphology is accumulating, we currently have little understanding of factors that may constrain evolutionary change in sperm traits. We investigated whether susceptibility to sperm abnormalities could represent such a constraint in songbirds, a group characterized by a distinctive helical sperm head shape. Specifically, using 36 songbird species and data from light and scanning electron microscopy, we examined among‚Äêspecies correlations between the occurrence of sperm head abnormalities and sperm morphology, as well as the correlation between sperm head abnormalities and two indicators of sperm competition. We found that species with more helically shaped sperm heads (i.e., a wider helical membrane and more pronounced cell waveform) had a higher percentage of abnormal sperm heads than species with less helical sperm (i.e., relatively straight sperm) and that sperm head traits were better predictors of head abnormalities than total sperm length. In contrast, there was no correlation between sperm abnormalities and the level of sperm competition. Given that songbird species with more pronounced helical sperm have higher average sperm swimming speed, our results suggest an evolutionary trade‚Äêoff between sperm performance and the structural integrity of the sperm head. As such, susceptibility to morphological abnormalities may constrain the evolution of helical sperm morphology in songbirds.",TRUE
Spider signals: are web decorations visible to birds and bees?,"We are becoming increasingly aware of animal communication outside the range of human sensitivity. Web decorations are silk structures used by orb-web spiders to deceive prey and predators. However, despite the level of interest in these structures, their visibility to prey and predators has never, to our knowledge, been objectively assessed. Here, we use spectrophotometric analyses to show that the decorations of all five tested spider species are visible to honey bees and birds over short and long distances. Furthermore, the discoid decorations of one species may provide some protection against arthropod predators. However, these decorations are inefficient at camouflaging the spider against birds, despite the overlap between the spider's body and web decoration.",TRUE
Spider silk as a novel high performance biomimetic muscle driven by humidity,"SUMMARY The abrupt halt of a bumble bee's flight when it impacts the almost invisible threads of an orb web provides an elegant example of the amazing strength and toughness of spider silk. Spiders depend upon these properties for survival, yet the impressive performance of silk is not limited solely to tensile mechanics. Here, we show that silk also exhibits powerful cyclic contractions, allowing it to act as a high performance mimic of biological muscles. These contractions are actuated by changes in humidity alone and repeatedly generate work 50 times greater than the equivalent mass of human muscle. Although we demonstrate that this response is general and occurs weakly in diverse hydrophilic materials, the high modulus of spider silk is such that it generates exceptional force. Furthermore, because this effect already operates at the level of single silk fibers, only 5 Œºm in diameter, it can easily be scaled across the entire size range at which biological muscles operate. By contrast, the most successful synthetic muscles developed so far are driven by electric voltage, such that they cannot scale easily across large ranges in cross-sectional areas. The potential applicability of silk muscles is further enhanced by our finding that silkworm fibers also exhibit cyclic contraction because they are already available in commercial quantities. The simplicity of using wet or dry air to drive the biomimetic silk muscle fibers and the incredible power generated by silk offer unique possibilities in designing lightweight and compact actuators for robots and micro-machines, new sensors, and green energy production.",TRUE

"Spiders avoid sticking to their webs: clever leg movements, branched drip-tip setae, and anti-adhesive surfaces","Orb-weaving spiders construct webs with adhesive silk but are not trapped by it. Previous studies have attributed this defense to an oily coating on their legs that protects against adhesion or, more recently, to behavioral avoidance of sticky lines. The old evidence is very weak, however, and the behavioral avoidance explanation is inadequate because orb-weavers push with their hind legs against sticky lines hundreds or thousands of times during construction of each orb and are not trapped. Video analyses of behavior and experimental observations of isolated legs pulling away from contact with sticky lines showed that the spider uses three anti-adhesion traits: dense arrays of branched setae on the legs that reduce the area of contact with adhesive material; careful engagement and withdrawal movements of its legs that minimize contact with the adhesive and that avoid pulling against the line itself; and a chemical coating or surface layer that reduces adhesion.",TRUE
Spiderweb deformation induced by electrostatically charged insects,"Capture success of spider webs has been associated with their microstructure, ornamentation, and wind-induced vibrations. Indirect evidence suggests that statically charged objects can attract silk thread, but web deformations induced by charged insects have not yet been described. Here, we show under laboratory conditions that electrostatically charged honeybees, green bottle flies, fruit flies, aphids, and also water drops falling near webs of cross-spiders (Araneus diadematus) induce rapid thread deformation that enhances the likelihood of physical contact, and thus of prey capture.",TRUE
Spontaneous unraveling of hagfish slime thread skeins is mediated by a seawater-soluble protein adhesive,"Hagfishes are known for their ability to rapidly produce vast quantities of slime when provoked. The slime is formed via the interaction between seawater and two components released by the slime glands: mucin vesicles from gland mucous cells, which swell and rupture in seawater to form a network of mucus strands, and intermediate filament-rich threads, which are produced within gland thread cells as tightly coiled bundles called skeins. A previous study showed that the unraveling of skeins from Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) requires both the presence of mucins and hydrodynamic mixing. In contrast, skeins from Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) unravel in the absence of both mucins and mixing. We tested the hypothesis that spontaneous unraveling of E. stoutii skeins is triggered by the dissolution of a seawater-soluble protein adhesive and the release of stored strain energy within the coiled thread. Here we show that, as predicted by this hypothesis, unraveling can be initiated by a protease under conditions in which unraveling does not normally occur. We also demonstrate, using high resolution scanning electron microscopy, that the treatment of skeins with solutions that cause unraveling also leads to the disappearance of surface and inter-thread features that remain when skeins are washed with stabilizing solutions. Our study provides a mechanism for the deployment of thread skeins in Pacific hagfish slime, and raises the possibility of producing novel biomimetic protein adhesives that are salt, temperature and kosmotrope sensitive.",TRUE
Spray aiming in the bombardier beetle: photographic evidence.,"Bombardier beetles, when physically assaulted, eject a hot quinonoid spray from the tip of the abdomen. Photographic evidence is presented demonstrating that the African bombardier beetle, Stenaptinus insignis, can aim its spray in virtually any direction. It can target its individual legs, and even the individual segments of its legs. Moreover, in aiming at a leg, it takes into account the postural orientation of that leg. The beetle is able even to target sites on its back. It is postulated that the ability to aim helps the beetle mainly in defense against ants.",TRUE
Squalamine as a broad-spectrum systemic antiviral agent with therapeutic potential,"Antiviral compounds that increase the resistance of host tissues represent an attractive class of therapeutic. Here, we show that squalamine, a compound previously isolated from the tissues of the dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias) and the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against human pathogens, which were studied in vitro as well as in vivo. Both RNA- and DNA-enveloped viruses are shown to be susceptible. The proposed mechanism involves the capacity of squalamine, a cationic amphipathic sterol, to neutralize the negative electrostatic surface charge of intracellular membranes in a way that renders the cell less effective in supporting viral replication. Because squalamine can be readily synthesized and has a known safety profile in man, we believe its potential as a broad-spectrum human antiviral agent should be explored.",TRUE

Stabilization and swelling of hagfish slime mucin vesicles,"SUMMARY When agitated, Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) produce large quantities of slime that consists of hydrated bundles of protein filaments and membrane-bound mucin vesicles from numerous slime glands. When the slime exudate contacts seawater, the thread bundles unravel and the mucin vesicles swell and rupture. Little is known about the mechanisms of vesicle rupture in seawater and stabilization within the gland, although it is believed that the vesicle membrane is permeable to most ions except polyvalent anions. We hypothesized that the most abundant compounds within the slime gland exudate have a stabilizing effect on the mucin vesicles. To test this hypothesis, we measured the chemical composition of the fluid component of hagfish slime exudate and conducted functional assays with these solutes to test their ability to keep the vesicles in a condensed state. We found K+ concentrations that were elevated relative to plasma, and Na+, Cl‚àí and Ca2+ concentrations that were considerably lower. Our analysis also revealed high levels of methylamines such as trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), betaine and dimethylglycine, which had a combined concentration of 388 mmol l‚àí1 in the glandular fluid. In vitro rupture assays demonstrated that both TMAO and betaine had a significant effect on rupture, but neither was capable of completely abolishing mucin swelling and rupture, even at high concentrations. This suggests that some other mechanism such as the chemical microenvironment within gland mucous cells, or hydrostatic pressure is responsible for stabilization of the vesicles within the gland.",TRUE
"Stationary underwater prey missed by reef herons,Egretta gularis: head position and light refraction at the moment of strike","SummaryThis paper attempts to verify the importance of spatial positioning of the eyes of reef heronsEgretta gularis schistacea, when coping with light refraction at the air-water interface. The herons' striking of prey, while their approach angle was restricted, was observed. (a) The herons' capture success in the restricted situation was markedly lower than in the unrestricted situation. (b) The points of strike (STR) in unsuccessful strikes differed from those of successful strikes, and from those of the unrestricted situation. (c) The larger the difference between the observed and the predicted ratio of prey depth to apparent prey depth, the higher the probability of missing a prey. These results support predictions of a model presented elsewhere (Katzir and Intrator 1987) that a heron will attempt to reach spatial positions at which prey's real depth and apparent depth are linearly correlated.",TRUE
Stimulation of DNA repair as an evolutionary drive for bacterial luminescence.,"It was demonstrated recently that luminescence of a free-living marine bacterium, Vibrio harveyi, stimulates DNA repair, most probably by activation of the photoreactivation process. Here, we ask whether the stimulation of DNA repair could be an evolutionary drive that ensured maintenance and development of early bacterial luminescent systems. To test this hypothesis, we cultivated V. harveyi lux(+) bacteria and luxA mutants in mixed cultures. Initial cultures were mixed to obtain a culture consisting of roughly 50% lux(+) cells and 50% luxA mutants. Then bacteria were cultivated for several days and ratio of luminescent to dark bacteria was measured. Under these conditions, luxA mutants became highly predominant within a few days of cultivation. This indicates that, without a selective pressure, the luminescence is a disadvantage for bacteria, perhaps due to consumption of significant portion of cell energy. However, when the same experiments were repeated but cultures were irradiated with low UV doses, luminescent bacteria started to predominate shortly after the irradiation. Therefore, we conclude that stimulation of photoreactivation may be an evolutionary drive for bacterial bioluminescence.",TRUE
Stochastic Mechanisms of Cell-Size Regulation in Bacteria.,"How bacteria are able to maintain their sizes remains an open question. It is believed that cells have narrow distributions of sizes as a consequence of a homeostasis that allows bacteria to function at the optimal conditions. Several phenomenological approaches to explain these observations have been presented, but the microscopic origins of the cell-size regulation are still not understood. Here, we propose a new stochastic approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms of maintaining the cell sizes in bacteria. It is argued that the cell-size regulation is a result of coupling of two stochastic processes, cell growth and division, which eliminates the need for introducing the thresholds. Dynamic properties of the system are explicitly evaluated, and it is shown that the model is consistent with the experimentally supported adder principle of the cell-size regulation. In addition, theoretical predictions agree with experimental observations on E. coli bacteria. Theoretical analysis clarifies some important features of bacterial cell growth.",TRUE
Stochastic resonance in MoS2 photodetector,"In this article, we adopt a radical approach for next generation ultra-low-power sensor design by embracing the evolutionary success of animals with extraordinary sensory information processing capabilities that allow them to survive in extreme and resource constrained environments. Stochastic resonance (SR) is one of those astounding phenomena, where noise, which is considered detrimental for electronic circuits and communication systems, plays a constructive role in the detection of weak signals. Here, we show SR in a photodetector based on monolayer MoS2 for detecting ultra-low-intensity subthreshold optical signals from a distant light emitting diode (LED). We demonstrate that weak periodic LED signals, which are otherwise undetectable, can be detected by a MoS2 photodetector in the presence of a finite and optimum amount of white Gaussian noise at a frugal energy expenditure of few tens of nano-Joules. The concept of SR is generic in nature and can be extended beyond photodetector to any other sensors.",TRUE
"Stratum corneum keratin structure, function, and formation: the cubic rod-packing and membrane templating model.","A new model for stratum corneum keratin structure, function, and formation is presented. The structural and functional part of the model, which hereafter is referred to as ""the cubic rod-packing model"", postulates that stratum corneum keratin intermediate filaments are arranged according to a cubic-like rod-packing symmetry with or without the presence of an intracellular lipid membrane with cubic-like symmetry enveloping each individual filament. The new model could account for (i) the cryo-electron density pattern of the native corneocyte keratin matrix, (ii) the X-ray diffraction patterns, (iii) the swelling behavior, and (iv) the mechanical properties of mammalian stratum corneum. The morphogenetic part of the model, which hereafter is referred to as ""the membrane templating model"", postulates the presence in cellular space of a highly dynamic small lattice parameter (<30 nm) membrane structure with cubic-like symmetry, to which keratin is associated. It further proposes that membrane templating, rather than spontaneous self-assembly, is responsible for keratin intermediate filament formation and dynamics. The new model could account for (i) the cryo-electron density patterns of the native keratinocyte cytoplasmic space, (ii) the characteristic features of the keratin network formation process, (iii) the dynamic properties of keratin intermediate filaments, (iv) the close lipid association of keratin, (v) the insolubility in non-denaturating buffers and pronounced polymorphism of keratin assembled in vitro, and (vi) the measured reduction in cell volume and hydration level between the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum. Further, using cryo-transmission electron microscopy on native, fully hydrated, vitreous epidermis we show that the subfilametous keratin electron density pattern consists, both in corneocytes and in viable keratinocytes, of one axial subfilament surrounded by an undetermined number of peripheral subfilaments forming filaments with a diameter of approximately 8 nm.",TRUE
Strength at the extracellular matrix‚Äìmuscle interface,"Mechanical force is generated within skeletal muscle cells by contraction of specialized myofibrillar proteins. This paper explores how the contractile force generated at the sarcomeres within an individual muscle fiber is transferred through the connective tissue to move the bones. The initial key point for transfer of the contractile force is the muscle cell membrane (sarcolemma) where force is transferred laterally to the basement membrane (specialized extracellular matrix rich in laminins) to be integrated within the connective tissue (rich in collagens) before transmission to the tendons. Connections between (1) key molecules outside the myofiber in the basement membrane to (2) molecules within the sarcolemma of the myofiber and (3) the internal cytoplasmic structures of the cytoskeleton and sarcomeres are evaluated. Disturbances to many components of this complex interactive system adversely affect skeletal muscle strength and integrity, and can result in severe muscle diseases. The mechanical aspects of these crucial linkages are discussed, with particular reference to defects in laminin‚ÄêŒ±2 and integrin‚ÄêŒ±7. Novel interventions to potentially increase muscle strength and reduce myofiber damage are mentioned, and these are also highly relevant to muscle diseases and aging muscle.",TRUE
"Striking of underwater prey by a reef heron,Egretta gularis schistacea","SummaryThe ability of a piscivorous bird, the western reef heron,Egretta gularis schistacea, to cope with light refraction at the air/water interface was investigated. The heron's capture rate of small stationary underwater prey from a variety of angles was high, indicating an ability to correct for refraction. Two distinct phases were described during head movement: i) ‚ÄòPre-strike‚Äô (mean path angle 60¬∞ to the vertical, mean velocity 52 cm/s). ii) ‚ÄòStrike‚Äô (mean path angle 33¬∞, mean velocity 270 cm/s). When prey was unsubmerged the two phases were less distinct (‚Äòpre-strike‚Äô 47¬∞, 62 cm/s; ‚Äòstrike‚Äô 42¬∞, 154 cm/s). The point of change between phases (STR) was assumed to be the point at which corrections for refraction were performed. Calculated disparities between real and apparent prey positions at STR may reach 10 cm. At STR, highly significant correlations were found between i) the heron's eye height above the water, and prey depth, ii) the apparent prey depth and real prey depth. A model is presented to explain the heron's manner of correcting for light refraction.",TRUE
Strong ultralight foams based on nanocrystalline cellulose for high-performance insulation.,"Environmentally friendly, sustainable, and high-performance thermal insulators are in high demand. Petroleum-based insulator foams usually have high thermal conductivity and pose health hazards. Here, we report ultralight composite foams that are highly strong, elastic, and super-insulating. The foams are composed of nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) (74‚Äâwt%), polyvinyl alcohol (7.5‚Äâwt%), and a crosslinking agent (18.5‚Äâwt%). The fabrication process is simple and uses only water. The composite foams exhibit an elastic strain of Àú13% at a modulus of 250‚ÄâK‚ÄâPa and a stress of 73‚ÄâK‚ÄâPa at 50% strain (100+ and 18 times, respectively, higher than those of pure NCC foam); both exceed the values of reported nanocellulose-based foams with no reinforcement. The foams exhibit a thermal conductivity of 0.027 Wm-1‚ÄâK-1, which is superior to those of traditional insulating materials. The structural integrity is also preserved after burning. Our results show that NCC-based materials can be engineered towards high-performance insulation applications.",TRUE
Structural analysis of hydrophobins,"Hydrophobins are a remarkable class of small cysteine-rich proteins found exclusively in fungi. They self-assemble to form robust polymeric monolayers that are highly amphipathic and play numerous roles in fungal biology, such as in the formation and dispersal of aerial spores and in pathogenic and mutualistic interactions. The polymeric form can be reversibly disassembled and is able to reverse the wettability of a surface, leading to many proposals for nanotechnological applications over recent years. The surprising properties of hydrophobins and their potential for commercialization have led to substantial efforts to delineate their morphology and molecular structure. In this review, we summarize the progress that has been made using a variety of spectroscopic and microscopic approaches towards understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying hydrophobin structure.",TRUE

Structural design and biomechanics of friction-based releasable attachment devices in insects,"Design of attachment devices in insects varies enormously in relation to different functional loads.

Structural design of the minute clypeasteroid echinoid Echinocyamus pusillus,"The clypeasteroid echinoid skeleton is a multi-plated, light-weight shell construction produced by biomineralization processes. In shell constructions, joints between individual elements are considered as weak points, yet these echinoid skeletons show an extensive preservation potential in both Recent and fossil environments. The remarkable strength of the test is achieved by skeletal reinforcement structures and their constructional layouts. Micro-computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy are used for microstructural and volumetric analyses of the echinoid's skeleton. It is shown that strengthening mechanisms act on different hierarchical levels from the overall shape of the skeleton to skeletal interlocking. The tight-fitting and interlocking plate joints lead to a shell considered to behave as a monolithic structure. The plate's architecture features distinct regions interpreted as a significant load-transferring system. The internal support system follows the segmentation of the remaining skeleton, where sutural layout and stereom distribution are designed for effective load transfer. The structural analysis of the multi-plated, yet monolithic skeleton of Echinocyamus pusillus reveals new aspects of the micro-morphology and its structural relevance for the load-bearing behaviour. The analysed structural principles allow E. pusillus to be considered as a role model for the development of multi-element, light-weight shell constructions.",TRUE
Structural fiber reinforcement of keel blubber in harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena),"This study investigated the functional morphology of the blubber that forms the caudal keels of the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Blubber is a pliant biocomposite formed by adipocytes and structural fibers composed of collagen and elastic fibers. Caudal keels are dorsally and ventrally placed triangular wedges of blubber that define the hydrodynamic profile of the porpoise tailstock. Mechanical tests on carcasses demonstrate that when keels are bent, they strain nonuniformly along their lengths, with highest strains just caudal to the dorsal fin and lowest at the insertion of the flukes. Therefore, caudal keels undergo nonuniform longitudinal deformation while maintaining a stable, triangular cross-sectional shape. Polarizing and transmitted light microscopy techniques were used to investigate blubber's 3D fiber architecture along the length of the dorsal keel. The triangular cross-sectional shape of the keel appears to be maintained by structural fibers oriented to act as tensile stays. The construction of the blubber composite is regionally specific :structural fiber densities and diameters are higher in the relatively stiff caudal region of the keel than in the more deformable cranial keel region. The orientations of structural fibers also change along the length of the keel. Cranially, no fibers are oriented along the long axis, whereas a novel population of longitudinally oriented fibers reinforces the keel at the insertion of the flukes. Thus, differences in the distribution and orientation of structural fibers contribute to the regionally specific mechanical properties of the dorsal keel.",TRUE
Structural origins of high-affinity biotin binding to streptavidin,"The high affinity of the noncovalent interaction between biotin and streptavidin forms the basis for many diagnostic assays that require the formation of an irreversible and specific linkage between biological macromolecules. Comparison of the refined crystal structures of apo and a streptavidin:biotin complex shows that the high affinity results from several factors. These factors include the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions between biotin and the protein, together with the ordering of surface polypeptide loops that bury the biotin in the protein interior. Structural alterations at the biotin binding site produce quaternary changes in the streptavidin tetramer. These changes apparently propagate through cooperative deformations in the twisted beta sheets that link tetramer subunits.",TRUE
Structural plasticity and catalysis regulation of a thermosensor histidine kinase,"Temperature sensing is essential for the survival of living cells. A major challenge is to understand how a biological thermometer processes thermal information to optimize cellular functions. Using structural and biochemical approaches, we show that the thermosensitive histidine kinase, DesK, from Bacillus subtilis is cold-activated through specific interhelical rearrangements in its central four-helix bundle domain. As revealed by the crystal structures of DesK in different functional states, the plasticity of this helical domain influences the catalytic activities of the protein, either by modifying the mobility of the ATP-binding domains for autokinase activity or by modulating binding of the cognate response regulator to sustain the phosphotransferase and phosphatase activities. The structural and biochemical data suggest a model in which the transmembrane sensor domain of DesK promotes these structural changes through conformational signals transmitted by the membrane-connecting two-helical coiled-coil, ultimately controlling the alternation between output autokinase and phosphatase activities. The structural comparison of the different DesK variants indicates that incoming signals can take the form of helix rotations and asymmetric helical bends similar to those reported for other sensing systems, suggesting that a similar switching mechanism could be operational in a wide range of sensor histidine kinases.",TRUE
Structural snapshots of the minimal PKS system responsible for octaketide biosynthesis,"Type II polyketide synthases (PKSs) are multi-enzyme complexes that produce secondary metabolites of medical relevance. Chemical backbones of such polyketides are produced by minimal PKS systems that consist of a malonyl transacylase, an acyl carrier protein and an Œ±/Œ≤ heterodimeric ketosynthase. Here, we present X-ray structures of all ternary complexes that constitute the minimal PKS system for anthraquinone biosynthesis in Photorhabdus luminescens . In addition, we characterize this invariable core using molecular simulations, mutagenesis experiments and functional assays. We show that malonylation of the acyl carrier protein is accompanied by major structural rearrangements in the transacylase. Principles of an ongoing chain elongation are derived from the ternary complex with a hexaketide covalently linking the heterodimeric ketosynthase with the acyl carrier protein. Our results for the minimal PKS system provide mechanistic understanding of PKSs and a fundamental basis for engineering PKS pathways for future applications. The invariable core of a type II polyketide synthase has been characterized using X-ray crystallography, simulations, mutagenesis experiments and functional assays. The characterization of the ternary acyl carrier protein complexes provides a mechanistic understanding of the reactivity and could inform future engineering of this complex biosynthetic machinery.",TRUE
Structural Strengthening of Urchin Skeletons by Collagenous Sutural Ligaments.,"Sea urchin skeletons are strengthened by flexible collagenous ligaments that bind together rigid calcite plates at sutures. Whole skeletons without ligaments (removed by bleaching) broke at lower apically applied forces than did intact, fresh skeletons. In addition, in three-point bending tests on excised plate combinations, sutural ligaments strengthened sutures but not plates. The degree of sutural strengthening by ligaments depended on sutural position; in tensile tests, ambital and adapical sutures were strengthened more than adoral sutures. Adapical sutures, which grow fastest, were also the loosest, suggesting that strengthening by ligaments is associated with growth. In fed, growing urchins, sutures overall were looser than in unfed urchins. Looseness was demonstrated visually and by vibration analysis: bleached skeletons of unfed urchins rang at characteristic frequencies, indicating that sound traveled across tightly fitting sutures; skeletons of fed urchins damped vibrations, indicating loss of vibrational energy across looser sutures. Furthermore, bleached skeletons of fed urchins broke at lower apically applied forces than bleached skeletons of unfed urchins, indicating that the sutures of fed urchins had been held together relatively loosely by sutural ligaments. Thus, the apparently rigid dome-like skeleton of urchins sometimes transforms into a flexible, jointed membrane as sutures loosen and become flexible during growth.",TRUE
Structurally assisted super black in colourful peacock spiders,"Male peacock spiders (Maratus, Salticidae) compete to attract female mates using elaborate, sexually selected displays. They evolved both brilliant colour and velvety black. Here, we use scanning electron microscopy, hyperspectral imaging and finite-difference time-domain optical modelling to investigate the deep black surfaces of peacock spiders. We found that super black regions reflect less than 0.5% of light (for a 30¬∞ collection angle) in Maratus speciosus (0.44%) and Maratus karrie (0.35%) owing to microscale structures. Both species evolved unusually high, tightly packed cuticular bumps (microlens arrays), and M. karrie has an additional dense covering of black brush-like scales atop the cuticle. Our optical models show that the radius and height of spider microlenses achieve a balance between (i) decreased surface reflectance and (ii) enhanced melanin absorption (through multiple scattering, diffraction out of the acceptance cone of female eyes and increased path length of light through absorbing melanin pigments). The birds of paradise (Paradiseidae), ecological analogues of peacock spiders, also evolved super black near bright colour patches. Super black locally eliminates white specular highlights, reference points used to calibrate colour perception, making nearby colours appear brighter, even luminous, to vertebrates. We propose that this pre-existing, qualitative sensory experience‚Äî‚Äòsensory bias‚Äô‚Äîis also found in spiders, leading to the convergent evolution of super black for mating displays in jumping spiders.",TRUE
Structure and Mechanical Adaptability of a Modern Elasmoid Fish Scale from the Common Carp,"Summary The carp (Cyprinus carpio) has typical elasmoid scales commonly found on teleosts. They provide protection while retaining flexibility and maneuverability of the fish. The exterior surface of the scale consists of an ultrathin discontinuous mineral layer on top of mineralized woven collagen fibrils. The underlying foundation is composed of two collagenous components. The major one consists of a single-twisted ‚ÄúBouligand‚Äù structure with a twisting angle of 36¬∞. A secondary ‚Äúsheet-like‚Äù structure, formed by thinner collagen fibrils oriented along the thickness direction, acts to increase the integrity of the scale. Here, we identify the deformation and failure mechanisms of the carp scale, revealing slight tensile anisotropy. Using in situ small-angle X-ray scattering during tensile testing, the toughening mechanisms of the scale, including the adaptive structural reorientation of lamellae as well as fibrillar sliding and elastic deformation, are quantified and compared with those of other fish scales.",TRUE
Structure and mechanical behavior of a toucan beak,"Abstract The toucan beak, which comprises one third of the length of the bird and yet only about 1/20th of its mass, has outstanding stiffness. The structure of a Toco toucan (Ramphastos toco) beak was found to be a sandwich composite with an exterior of keratin and a fibrous network of closed cells made of calcium-rich proteins. The keratin layer is comprised of superposed hexagonal scales (50¬†Œºm diameter and 1¬†Œºm thickness) glued together. Its tensile strength is about 50¬†MPa and Young‚Äôs modulus is 1.4¬†GPa. Micro and nanoindentation hardness measurements corroborate these values. The keratin shell exhibits a strain-rate sensitivity with a transition from slippage of the scales due to release of the organic glue, at a low strain rate (5¬†√ó¬†10‚àí5/s) to fracture of the scales at a higher strain rate (1.5¬†√ó¬†10‚àí3/s). The closed-cell foam is comprised of fibers having a Young‚Äôs modulus twice as high as the keratin shells due to their higher calcium content. The compressive response of the foam was modeled by the Gibson‚ÄìAshby constitutive equations for open and closed-cell foam. There is a synergistic effect between foam and shell evidenced by experiments and analysis establishing the separate responses of shell, foam, and foam¬†+¬†shell. The stability analysis developed by Karam and Gibson, assuming an idealized circular cross section, was applied to the beak. It shows that the foam stabilizes the deformation of the beak by providing an elastic foundation which increases its Brazier and buckling load under flexure loading.",TRUE
Structure of the avian respiratory tract.,"Abstract The avian lung is firmly attached to the thoracic wall and to the underlying horizontal septum. Its volume remains constant during respiration. Air sacs lie beneath the horizontal septum, the oblique septum separating them from the intestines; the abdominal air sac occupies the dorsal abdominal cavity. At the lung hilus the primary bronchus gives off four ventrobronchi, and posteriorly seven to ten dorsobronchi and the laterobronchi. Parabronchi, the functional unit of the avian lung for gas exchange, originate from the total internal surface of these secondary bronchi, connecting ventrobronchi to dorso- and laterobronchi. The three anterior air sacs are connected to the ventrobronchi. The posterior thoracic and the abdominal air sacs are connected to the large laterobronchus and to the end of the primary bronchus, respectively. The air sacs act as bellows ventilating the lung. The special shape of the primary bronchus, the origin of the secondary bronchi and the air sac connections determine the unidirectional ventilation of the parabronchi in this ‚Äúpaleopuimo‚Äù during both respiratory phases. This basic structure found in all birds is supplemented in more highly evolved species by a secondary parabronchial network, the ‚Äúneopuimo‚Äù, connecting the primary bronchus and the posterior air sacs. It demonstrates a changing direction of air flow in accordance with the respiratory phase. The parabronchial structure and its vascular system are described.",TRUE
"Structure, innervation and response properties of integumentary sensory organs in crocodilians","SUMMARY Integumentary sensory organs (ISOs) are densely distributed on the jaws of crocodilians and on body scales of members of the families Crocodilidae and Gavialidae. We examined the distribution, anatomy, innervation and response properties of ISOs on the face and body of crocodilians and documented related behaviors for an alligatorid (Alligator mississippiensis) and a crocodylid (Crocodylus niloticus). Each of the ISOs (roughly 4000 in A. mississippiensis and 9000 in C. niloticus) was innervated by networks of afferents supplying multiple different mechanoreceptors. Electrophysiological recordings from the trigeminal ganglion and peripheral nerves were made to isolate single-unit receptive fields and to test possible osmoreceptive and electroreceptive functions. Multiple small (<0.1 mm2) receptive fields, often from a single ISO, were recorded from the premaxilla, the rostral dentary, the gingivae and the distal digits. These responded to a median threshold of 0.08 mN. The less densely innervated caudal margins of the jaws had larger receptive fields (>100 mm2) and higher thresholds (13.725 mN). Rapidly adapting, slowly adapting type I and slowly adapting type II responses were identified based on neuronal responses. Several rapidly adapting units responded maximally to vibrations at 20‚Äì35 Hz, consistent with reports of the ISOs' role in detecting prey-generated water surface ripples. Despite crocodilians' armored bodies, the ISOs imparted a mechanical sensitivity exceeding that of primate fingertips. We conclude that crocodilian ISOs have diverse functions, including detection of water movements, indicating when to bite based on direct contact of pursued prey, and fine tactile discrimination of items held in the jaws.",TRUE
"Structure, mechanism and mechanical properties of pupal attachment in Greta oto (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Ithomiinae)","The structure and mechanism of pupal attachment are described for the nymphalid Greta oto using electron microscopy, and high‚Äêspeed and time‚Äêlapse photography. The cremaster is composed of a 3‚ÄêD array of hooked setae that engage with silk fibers spun into layers in a pad on the lower leaf surface. Each seta comprises a shaft terminating in a strongly curved hook, tipped with two lateral barbs. These hook into the silk pad, which is densely laid and built‚Äêup in the central portion, flattening out peripherally. Time‚Äêlapse photography showed that silk pad construction by fifth instar larvae is completed in four distinct spinning movements, producing a random fiber arrangement. It is proposed that such a fiber arrangement provides isotropic strength, giving greater flexibility to the attachment. The cremaster is attached to the silk pad by a series of lateral movements of the pupa's posterior abdomen. This movement, together with the shape of the setal hooks, is thought to be integral to the attachment process. Tensile loading tests showed that attachment failure is due to the breakage of the silk pad, which undergoes gradual destruction before releasing the cremaster. The attachment was found to have high tensile strength and fracture toughness, both of which suggest that it has evolved for the dual purpose of preventing the pupa being pulled from the leaf by a predator and preventing the attachment being weakened by wind, which causes the pupa to swing.",TRUE
STUDIES OF TROPICAL TUNA SWIMMING PERFORMANCE IN A LARGE WATER TUNNEL - KINEMATICS,"Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) swimming kinematics was studied in a large water tunnel at controlled swimming velocities (U). Quantified kinematic variables included the tail-beat frequency, stride length (l), caudal amplitude, yaw, the propulsive wavelength, the speed of the propulsive wave (C) and the sweepback angle of the pectoral fins. In general, all variables, except the propulsive wavelength and consequently C, are comparable to values determined for other teleosts. The propulsive wavelength for the tunas (1.23&shy;1.29 L, where L is fork length) is 30&shy;60 % longer than in other cruise-adapted teleosts such as salmonids. The resulting thunniform swimming mode and the morphological and anatomical adaptations associated with the long propulsive wavelength (e.g. fusiform body shape, rigid vertebral column) act to minimize anterior resistance and maximize caudal thrust. The long propulsive wavelength also increases the maximum l which, in concert with the elevated muscle temperatures of tunas, increases their maximum swimming velocity.",TRUE
Studies on the morphology and function of the skull in the boidae (Serpentes). Part II. Morphology and function of the jaw apparatus in Python sebae and Python molurus,"Heads of the boid snakes Python sebae and Python molurus were dissected and the arthrology, myology and dentition studied. Living specimens of these species were observed and their feeding behavior analyzed by means of high‚Äê and regular‚Äêspeed motion pictures. Camera speeds of up to 400 frames per second permitted examination of the jaw movements during the striking and seizing of prey. Motion picture studies conducted at regular speeds provided information on cranial movements during the swallowing of prey. The morphology of the head was correlated with observed movements in an attempt to analyze the functional and adaptive implications of the jaw apparatus.",TRUE
Study of the geometry and folding pattern of leaves of Mimosa pudica,"Many structural and functional properties possessed by plants have great potentials to stimulate new concepts and innovative ideas in the field of biomimetic engineering. The key inputs from biology can be used for creation of efficient and optimized structures. The study of the geometry and folding pattern of leaves of Mimosa pudica, referred as Sensitive Plant, reveals some of the peculiar characteristics during folding and unfolding. When the leaf is touched, it quickly folds its leaflets and pinnae and droops downward at the petiole attachment. With the help of experiments on simulation model, the variations in angle of leaflets and degree of compaction after folding are investigated.",TRUE
Subnanometer atomic force microscopy of peptide-mineral interactions links clustering and competition to acceleration and catastrophe.,"In vitro observations have revealed major effects on the structure, growth, and composition of biomineral phases, including stabilization of amorphous precursors, acceleration and inhibition of kinetics, and alteration of impurity signatures. However, deciphering the mechanistic sources of these effects has been problematic due to a lack of tools to resolve molecular structures on mineral surfaces during growth. Here we report atomic force microscopy investigations using a system designed to maximize resolution while minimizing contact force. By imaging the growth of calcium-oxalate monohydrate under the influence of aspartic-rich peptides at single-molecule resolution, we reveal how the unique interactions of polypeptides with mineral surfaces lead to acceleration, inhibition, and switching of growth between two distinct states. Interaction with the positively charged face of calcium-oxalate monohydrate leads to formation of a peptide film, but the slow adsorption kinetics and gradual relaxation to a well-bound state result in time-dependent effects. These include a positive feedback between peptide adsorption and step inhibition described by a mathematical catastrophe that results in growth hysteresis, characterized by rapid switching from fast to near-zero growth rates for very small reductions in supersaturation. Interactions with the negatively charged face result in formation of peptide clusters that impede step advancement. The result is a competition between accelerated solute attachment and inhibition due to blocking of the steps by the clusters. The findings have implications for control of pathological mineralization and suggest artificial strategies for directing crystallization.",TRUE
Super black and ultrathin amorphous carbon film inspired by anti-reflection architecture in butterfly wing,Abstract An ultrathin and super black amorphous carbon (a-C) film has been fabricated by borrowing the inverse V-type anti-reflection nano-architecture from the black wings of butterfly Ornithoptera goliath through vacuum sintering process.

"Super-lampreys and wave energy: Optimised control of artificially-evolved, simulated swimming lamprey","Propulsion in the lamprey, an eel-like fish, is governed by activity in its spinal neural network (called a central pattern generator (CPG)). This CPG is simulated, in accordance with Ekeberg's original model, and optimised alternatives are generated with genetic algorithms (GAs). A two-phase GA is adopted: (1) to evolve neuron-descriptive parameters and synaptic weights of the neural oscillator for a single lamprey segment, (2) to generate interconnections between segments. Results demonstrate that Ekeberg's prototype is not a unique solution and that simpler versions with wider operational ranges can be generated. Evolved solutions outperform the swimming capabilities of a modelled biological organism, as an initial step in understanding how to control wave power devices, with similar motion to the lamprey.",TRUE
Supercontraction forces in spider dragline silk depend on hydration rate.,"Spider dragline silk is a model biological polymer for biomimetic research due to its many desirable and unusual properties. 'Supercontraction' describes the dramatic shrinking of dragline silk fibers when wetted. In restrained silk fibers, supercontraction generates substantial stresses of 40-50 MPa above a critical humidity of approximately 70% relative humidity (RH). This stress may maintain tension in webs under the weight of rain or dew and could be used in industry for robotics, sensor technology, and other applications. Our own findings indicate that supercontraction can generate stress over a much broader range than previously reported, from 10 to 140 MPa. Here we show that this variation in supercontraction stress depends upon the rate at which the environment reaches the critical level of humidity causing supercontraction. Slow humidity increase, over several minutes, leads to relatively low supercontraction stress, while fast humidity increase, over a few seconds, typically results in higher supercontraction stress. Slowly supercontracted fibers take up less water and differ in thermostability from rapidly supercontracted fibers, as shown by thermogravimetric analysis. This suggests that spider silk achieves different molecular configurations depending upon the speed at which supercontraction occurs. Ultimately, rate-dependent supercontraction may provide a mechanism to tailor the properties of silk or biomimetic fibers for various applications.",TRUE
Superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic plant surfaces: an inspiration for biomimetic materials,"The diversity of plant surface structures, evolved over 460 million years, has led to a large variety of highly adapted functional structures. The plant cuticle provides structural and chemical modifications for surface wetting, ranging from superhydrophilic to superhydrophobic. In this paper, the structural basics of superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic plant surfaces and their biological functions are introduced. Wetting in plants is influenced by the sculptures of the cells and by the fine structure of the surfaces, such as folding of the cuticle, or by epicuticular waxes. Hierarchical structures in plant surfaces are shown and further types of plant surface structuring leading to superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity are presented. The existing and potential uses of superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic surfaces for self-cleaning, drag reduction during moving in water, capillary liquid transport and other biomimetic materials are shown.",TRUE
Superhydrophobic diving flies (Ephydra hians) and the hypersaline waters of Mono Lake,"Significance Superhydrophobic surfaces have been of key academic and commercial interest since the discovery of the so-called lotus effect in 1977. The effect of different ions on complex superhydrophobic biological systems, however, has received little attention. By bringing together ecology, biomechanics, physics, and chemistry our study provides insight into the ion-specific effects of wetting in the presence of sodium carbonate and its large-scale consequences. By comparing the surface structure and chemistry of the alkali fly‚Äîan important food source for migrating birds‚Äîto other species we show that their uniquely hydrophobic properties arise from very small physical and chemical changes, thereby connecting picoscale physics with globally important ecological impacts. The remarkable alkali fly, Ephydra hians, deliberately crawls into the alkaline waters of Mono Lake to feed and lay eggs. These diving flies are protected by an air bubble that forms around their superhydrophobic cuticle upon entering the lake. To study the physical mechanisms underlying this process we measured the work required for flies to enter and leave various aqueous solutions. Our measurements show that it is more difficult for the flies to escape from Mono Lake water than from fresh water, due to the high concentration of Na2CO3 which causes water to penetrate and thus wet their setose cuticle. Other less kosmotropic salts do not have this effect, suggesting that the phenomenon is governed by Hofmeister effects as well as specific interactions between ion pairs. These effects likely create a small negative charge at the air‚Äìwater interface, generating an electric double layer that facilitates wetting. Compared with six other species of flies, alkali flies are better able to resist wetting in a 0.5 M Na2CO3 solution. This trait arises from a combination of factors including a denser layer of setae on their cuticle and the prevalence of smaller cuticular hydrocarbons compared with other species. Although superbly adapted to resisting wetting, alkali flies are vulnerable to getting stuck in natural and artificial oils, including dimethicone, a common ingredient in sunscreen and other cosmetics. Mono Lake‚Äôs alkali flies are a compelling example of how the evolution of picoscale physical and chemical changes can allow an animal to occupy an entirely new ecological niche.",TRUE
Surface protection in bio-shields via a functional soft skin layer: Lessons from the turtle shell.,"The turtle shell is a functional bio-shielding element, which has evolved naturally to provide protection against predator attacks that involve biting and clawing. The near-surface architecture of the turtle shell includes a soft bi-layer skin coating - rather than a hard exterior - which functions as a first line of defense against surface damage. This architecture represents a novel type of bio-shielding configuration, namely, an inverse structural-mechanical design, rather than the hard-coated bio-shielding elements identified so far. In the current study, we used experimentally based structural modeling and FE simulations to analyze the mechanical significance of this unconventional protection architecture in terms of resistance to surface damage upon extensive indentations. We found that the functional bi-layer skin of the turtle shell, which provides graded (soft-softer-hard) mechanical characteristics to the bio-shield exterior, serves as a bumper-buffer mechanism. This material-level adaptation protects the inner core from the highly localized indentation loads via stress delocalization and extensive near-surface plasticity. The newly revealed functional bi-layer coating architecture can potentially be adapted, using synthetic materials, to considerably enhance the surface load-bearing capabilities of various engineering configurations.",TRUE
"Surface structure and frictional properties of the skin of the Amazon tree boa Corallus hortulanus (Squamata, Boidae)","The legless locomotion of snakes requires specific adaptations of their ventral scales to maintain friction force in different directions. The skin microornamentation of the snake Corallus hortulanus was studied by means of scanning electron microscopy and the friction properties of the skin were tested on substrates of different roughness. Skin samples from various parts of the body (dorsal, lateral, ventral) were compared. Dorsal and lateral scales showed similar, net-like microornamentation and similar friction coefficients. Average friction coefficients for dorsal and lateral scales on the epoxy resin surfaces were 0.331 and 0.323, respectively. In contrast, ventral scales possess ridges running parallel to the longitudinal body axis. They demonstrated a significantly lower friction coefficient compared to both dorsal and lateral scales (0.191 on average). In addition, ventral scales showed frictional anisotropy comparing longitudinal and perpendicular direction of the ridges. This study clearly demonstrates that different skin microstructure is responsible for different frictional properties in different body regions.",TRUE
Surface tension prey transport in shorebirds: how widespread is it?,"Surface tension prey transport is a feeding mechanism employing the surface tension of water surrounding prey to transport prey from bill tip to mouth. Previously, it has been demonstrated only in the Red-necked Phalarope Phalaropus lobatus. On the basis of a model of the bill morphology necessary for this method of prey transport, I suggest that many species of shorebird should be capable of surface tension feeding. Laboratory investigations of the feeding mechanics of Wilson's Phalarope Phalaropus tricolor, Western Sandpiper Calidris mauri and Least Sandpiper Calidris minutilla demonstrated that all three use surface tension transport of prey when feeding in water. I examined interspecific variation in the performance of this feeding mechanism with a high-speed video system and a customized motion analysis system. Exploratory analyses indicated significant interspecific variation in distance the prey is transported per cycle of mandibular spreading, gape increase per unit transport, speed of transport, total number of cycles necessary to complete transport and total time to complete transport. The calidrid sandpipers also occasionally used other feeding mechanisms in conjunction with surface tension transport of prey. The discovery that these sandpipers, which normally obtain prey by probing, are capable of surface tension transport of prey implies that the capacity to employ this feeding mechanism may be widespread in the Scolopacidae and may have been a significant factor in the evolutionary radiation of phalaropes into aquatic environments.",TRUE
Surface tension propulsion of fungal spores,"SUMMARY Most basidiomycete fungi actively eject their spores. The process begins with the condensation of a water droplet at the base of the spore. The fusion of the droplet onto the spore creates a momentum that propels the spore forward. The use of surface tension for spore ejection offers a new paradigm to perform work at small length scales. However, this mechanism of force generation remains poorly understood. To elucidate how fungal spores make effective use of surface tension, we performed a detailed mechanical analysis of the three stages of spore ejection: the transfer of energy from the drop to the spore, the work of fracture required to release the spore from its supporting structure and the kinetic energy of the spore after ejection. High-speed video imaging of spore ejection in Auricularia auricula and Sporobolomyces yeasts revealed that drop coalescence takes place over a short distance (‚àº5 Œºm) and energy transfer is completed in less than 4 Œºs. Based on these observations, we developed an explicit relation for the conversion of surface energy into kinetic energy during the coalescence process. The relation was validated with a simple artificial system and shown to predict the initial spore velocity accurately (predicted velocity: 1.2 m s‚Äì1; observed velocity: 0.8 m s‚Äì1 for A. auricula). Using calibrated microcantilevers, we also demonstrate that the work required to detach the spore from the supporting sterigma represents only a small fraction of the total energy available for spore ejection. Finally, our observations of this unique discharge mechanism reveal a surprising similarity with the mechanics of jumping in animals.",TRUE
Surface Tension Transport of Prey by Feeding Shorebirds: The Capillary Ratchet,"The variability of bird beak morphology reflects diverse foraging strategies. One such feeding mechanism in shorebirds involves surface tension‚Äìinduced transport of prey in millimetric droplets: By repeatedly opening and closing its beak in a tweezering motion, the bird moves the drop from the tip of its beak to its mouth in a stepwise ratcheting fashion. We have analyzed the subtle physical mechanism responsible for drop transport and demonstrated experimentally that the beak geometry and the dynamics of tweezering may be tuned to optimize transport efficiency. We also highlight the critical dependence of the capillary ratchet on the beak's wetting properties, thus making clear the vulnerability of capillary feeders to surface pollutants.",TRUE
Surfactants tailored by the class Actinobacteria,"Globally the change towards the establishment of a bio-based economy has resulted in an increased need for bio-based applications. This, in turn, has served as a driving force for the discovery and application of novel biosurfactants. The class Actinobacteria represents a vast group of microorganisms with the ability to produce a diverse range of secondary metabolites, including surfactants. Understanding the extensive nature of the biosurfactants produced by actinobacterial strains can assist in finding novel biosurfactants with new potential applications. This review therefore presents a comprehensive overview of the knowledge available on actinobacterial surfactants, the chemical structures that have been completely or partly elucidated, as well as the identity of the biosurfactant-producing strains. Producer strains of not yet elucidated compounds are discussed, as well as the original habitats of all the producer strains, which seems to indicate that biosurfactant production is environmentally driven. Methodology applied in the isolation, purification and structural elucidation of the different types of surface active compounds, as well as surfactant activity tests, are also discussed. Overall, actinobacterial surfactants can be summarized to include the dominantly occurring trehalose-comprising surfactants, other non-trehalose containing glycolipids, lipopeptides and the more rare actinobacterial surfactants. The lack of structural information on a large proportion of actinobacterial surfactants should be considered as a driving force to further explore the abundance and diversity of these compounds. This would allow for a better understanding of actinobacterial surface active compounds and their potential for biotechnological application.",TRUE
Survival of the cheapest,"Abstract Most of our resources, especially materials, are treated by economics as if the supply were infinite, when demonstrably it is not for those that are non-renewable. In his engineering, use of materials and energy, man lets design takes second place, whereas nature treats materials as expensive and designs with apparent care and attention to detail. This results in durable materials and cheap structures that are easy to recycle under ambient conditions. Examples illustrating this principle, which are given here, are drawn from both animals and plants with comments on the underlying mechanisms such as self-assembly of liquid crystal systems, use of composite structures, and control of fracture properties. The natural world, of which we are a significant part, has many examples of survival with minimum use of energy. These examples range from the production and use of materials to the organization of entire populations. But not all organisms exist in a half-lit, miserly half-life. Their (that is to say, our) driving purpose in life is to reproduce, and no organism (that is, me or you) would be here unless our parents had a strong urge to reproduce, something which we, mostly, inherit. So any way that we can have the largest number of surviving offspring will be favored. In doing this we are in competition with nearly all the other organisms in the vicinity. The ones with which we are overtly friendly are our immediate genetic (or to a lesser extent, social) relatives, and much has been made of the concept that it is our genes, rather than ourselves, that crave dominance.",TRUE
Symbiotic bacteria living in the hoopoe's uropygial gland prevent feather degradation,"SUMMARY Among potential agents that might damage bird feathers are certain microorganisms which secrete enzymes that digest keratin, as is the case of the ubiquitous bacterium Bacillus licheniformis, present in both the feathers and skin of wild birds. It is therefore a good candidate for testing the effects of bird defences against feather-degrading microorganisms. One of these defences is the oil secreted by the uropygial gland, which birds use to protect their feathers against parasites. In previous studies we have shown how Enterococcus faecalis strains isolated from nestling hoopoes exert antagonistic effects against B. licheniformis, mediated by the production of bacteriocins. Consequently we hypothesized that this enterococcus and the bacteriocins it engenders might act as a defence against feather-degrading microorganisms in hoopoes. We investigated this hypothesis in a series of laboratory experiments and evaluated the extent to which the keratinolytic effects caused by B. licheniformis were reduced by the E. faecalis MRR10-3 strain, isolated from hoopoes, and its bacteriocins. In different treatments, feathers or pure keratin was incubated with B. licheniformis, B. licheniformis together with E. faecalis MRR10-3, and B. licheniformis together with the bacteriocins produced by E. faecalis MRR10-3. Our results were in accordance with the predicted effects on hoopoe feathers. There was a significant decrease both in pure keratin loss and in feather degradation in the presence of the symbiotic bacterium or its bacteriocin. These results suggest that by preening their feathers hoopoes benefit from their symbiotic relationship with bacteriocin-producing enterococci, which constitute a chemical defence against feather degradation.",TRUE
Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation in the Fungus Gardens of Leaf-Cutter Ants,"Gardening for Ants and Termites Among the social insects, ants and termites are the most diverse and ecologically dominant. Termites are known to engage in a mutualism with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and Pinto-Tom√°s et al. (p. 1120) have identified similar relationships occurring among leaf-cutter ants, which maintain specialized nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their fungus gardens. Together, these mutualisms are a major source of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems. How is the evolutionary stability of such mutualistic cooperation maintained? Aanen et al. (p. 1103) show that the Termitomyces fungus cultured by termites remains highly related because mycelia of the same clone fuse together and grow more efficiently to out-compete rare clones. Leaf-cutting ants engage in a mutualism with nitrogen-fixing bacteria that help fertilize their fungus gardens. Bacteria-mediated acquisition of atmospheric N2 serves as a critical source of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems. Here we reveal that symbiotic nitrogen fixation facilitates the cultivation of specialized fungal crops by leaf-cutter ants. By using acetylene reduction and stable isotope experiments, we demonstrated that N2 fixation occurred in the fungus gardens of eight leaf-cutter ant species and, further, that this fixed nitrogen was incorporated into ant biomass. Symbiotic N2-fixing bacteria were consistently isolated from the fungus gardens of 80 leaf-cutter ant colonies collected in Argentina, Costa Rica, and Panama. The discovery of N2 fixation within the leaf-cutter ant‚àímicrobe symbiosis reveals a previously unrecognized nitrogen source in neotropical ecosystems.",TRUE
Sympodial construction of Fibonacci-type leaf rosettes in Pinguicula moranensis (Lentibulariaceae).,"BACKGROUND AND AIMSThe leaf rosettes of the carnivorous Pinguicula moranensis follow a spiral phyllotaxis approaching a Fibonacci pattern while the stalked flowers arise from extra-axillary sites between the leaves. The organization of this rosette has been discussed by various authors, with various results. The aim of the present study was to clarify the development of the flowering rosettes of this species.METHODSThe formation of the rosettes is shown with the aid of scanning electron microscopy.KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONSThe scanning electron micrographs show that each flower terminates an article (sympodial unit). The leaves of consecutive articles of such sympodially constructed rosettes are arranged along a spiral Fibonacci pattern (with divergence angles around 137 degrees). This results from homodromy of leaf initiation in consecutive articles with the first leaf (prophyll) of a new article inserted in an obliquely transverse position next to the floral scape that terminates the former article. Sympodial construction of flowering shoots and leaf rosettes is also known from Aloe, Gunnera and Philodendron. As a by-product of this study, the unidirectional development of the Pinguicula flower is confirmed and discussed.",TRUE
"Synergy of multiple partners, including freeloaders, increases host fitness in a multispecies mutualism","Understanding cooperation is a central challenge in biology, because natural selection should favor ‚Äúfree-loaders‚Äù that reap benefits without reciprocating. For interspecific cooperation (mutualism), most approaches to this paradox focus on costs and benefits of individual partners and the strategies mutualists use to associate with beneficial partners. However, natural selection acts on lifetime fitness, and most mutualists, particularly longer-lived species interacting with shorter-lived partners (e.g., corals and zooxanthellae, tropical trees and mycorrhizae) interact with multiple partner species throughout ontogeny. Determining how multiple partnerships might interactively affect lifetime fitness is a crucial unexplored link in understanding the evolution and maintenance of cooperation. The tropical tree Acacia drepanolobium associates with four symbiotic ant species whose short-term individual effects range from mutualistic to parasitic. Using a long-term dataset, we show that tree fitness is enhanced by partnering sequentially with sets of different ant symbionts over the ontogeny of a tree. These sets include a ‚Äústerilization parasite‚Äù that prevents reproduction and another that reduces tree survivorship. Trees associating with partner sets that include these ‚Äúparasites‚Äù enhance lifetime fitness by trading off survivorship and fecundity at different life stages. Our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating mutualism within a community context and suggest that lifespan inequalities among mutualists may help cooperation persist in the face of exploitation.",TRUE
Synergy of topoisomerase and structural-maintenance-of-chromosomes proteins creates a universal pathway to simplify genome topology,"Significance Vital biological processes such as gene transcription and cell division may be severely impaired by inevitable entanglements ensuing from the extreme length and confinement of the genome. The family of topoisomerase proteins has independently evolved in different organisms to resolve these topological problems, yet no existing model can explain how topoisomerase alone can reduce the topological complexity of DNA in vivo. We propose that a synergistic mechanism between topoisomerase and a family of slip-link‚Äìlike proteins called structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) can provide a pathway to systematically resolve topological entanglements even under physiological crowding and confinement. Given the ubiquity of topoisomerase and SMC, we argue that the uncovered mechanism is at work throughout the cell cycle and across different organisms. Topological entanglements severely interfere with important biological processes. For this reason, genomes must be kept unknotted and unlinked during most of a cell cycle. Type II topoisomerase (TopoII) enzymes play an important role in this process but the precise mechanisms yielding systematic disentanglement of DNA in vivo are not clear. Here we report computational evidence that structural-maintenance-of-chromosomes (SMC) proteins‚Äîsuch as cohesins and condensins‚Äîcan cooperate with TopoII to establish a synergistic mechanism to resolve topological entanglements. SMC-driven loop extrusion (or diffusion) induces the spatial localization of essential crossings, in turn catalyzing the simplification of knots and links by TopoII enzymes even in crowded and confined conditions. The mechanism we uncover is universal in that it does not qualitatively depend on the specific substrate, whether DNA or chromatin, or on SMC processivity; we thus argue that this synergy may be at work across organisms and throughout the cell cycle.",TRUE
Synthesis and characterization of molybdenum disulfide nanoparticles in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 biofilms.,"Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium capable of reducing various metal and sulfur compounds and precipitating them in nanoparticulate form. Here, we report the synthesis of molybdenum disulfide nanomaterials at the site of S. oneidensis biofilms grown in the presence of molybdenum trioxide and sodium thiosulfate. Samples from the growth medium were imaged using scanning electron microscopy and characterized using transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, absorbance spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction. These methods revealed the presence of molybdenum disulfide nanoparticle aggregates 50-300‚Äânm in diameter with both hexagonal and rhombohedral polytypes. As a biosynthesis method for molybdenum sulfide, the use of S. oneidensis offers the advantage of significantly reduced heat and chemical solvent input compared to conventional methods of synthesizing molybdenum disulfide nanoparticles.",TRUE
Teacher tree: The evolution of notch shape optimization from complex to simple,"Abstract Shape optimization of engineering components following the design rules of nature was started in the late eighties in the Karlsruhe Research Centre. The key idea was the natural observation that trees care by load-adaptive growth to maintain a uniform stress distribution at their surface. This means also that high stress peaks (notch stresses) are avoided as potential failure points. The computer simulation of this adaptive growth has been called Computer Aided Optimization (CAO). CAO is based on the use of the Finite-Element-Method (FEM). The present paper shows how 15 years after the CAO-method drastic simplifications are available. So notch shape optimization in many cases can be done without the FEM-codes, with a pocket calculator or even simpler with a graphic method.",TRUE
Temperature-triggered periodical thermogenic oscillations in skunk cabbage (Symplocarpus foetidus).,"The natural occurrence of temperature-triggered and light-independent thermogenic oscillation in the spadix of skunk cabbage, Symplocarpus foetidus, was discovered. The identified thermogenic oscillator had an accurate periodical cycle (ca. 60 min per cycle) that apparently responded to an increase or decrease in the spadix temperature with a threshold of less than 0.9 degrees C. Neither a constant ambient air temperature nor transient changes in the ambient air temperature within 10 min (19 degrees C --> 15 degrees C --> 19 degrees C) induced the temperature oscillation in the spadix. Moreover, the periodical cycles were independent of the weight of the spadix (2.5-9.2 g) and the amplitudes of the temperature oscillations were correlated with the magnitude of the changes in the spadix temperatures. These results imply that periodical temperature oscillations in the spadix of S. foetidus possess a quantitative regulatory process that involves a temperature sensation and subsequent heat production. Based on these results, we propose a time-dependent thermogenic oscillatory model that acts as a precise thermal regulator under dynamic environmental temperature changes.",TRUE
Temperatures of Desert Plants: Another Perspective on the Adaptability of Leaf Size,"Surface temperatures of perennial plants in the Sonoran Desert of California ranged from 20ÔøΩC above air temperature to over 18ÔøΩC below air temperature during rapid growth periods following rain. Desert cactus with large photosynthetic stem surfaces had the highest temperatures and lowest transpiration rates. Perennial plants with relatively small leaves had moderate transpiration rates and leaf temperatures close to air temperature. Desert perennials with relatively large leaves had leaf temperatures well below air temperature along with the greatest accompanying transpiration rates of over 20 micrograms per square centimeter per second, but also had correspondingly low temperatures for maximum photosynthesis. The low leaf temperatures measured for these large-leafed species are an exception to the more common pattern for desert plants whereby a smaller leaf size prevents overheating and leads to reductions in transpiration and increased water-use efficiency. The contribution of a larger leaf size to a lower leaf temperature, and thus higher rate of photosynthesis for these large-leafed species, may represent an adaptive pattern previously unrecognized for desert plants.",TRUE
Temporal Signatures of Criticality in Human Cortical Excitability as Probed by Early Somatosensory Responses,"Brain responses vary considerably from moment to moment, even to identical sensory stimuli. This has been attributed to changes in instantaneous neuronal states determining the system's excitability. Yet the spatiotemporal organization of these dynamics remains poorly understood. Here we test whether variability in stimulus-evoked activity can be interpreted within the framework of criticality, which postulates dynamics of neural systems to be tuned toward the phase transition between stability and instability as is reflected in scale-free fluctuations in spontaneous neural activity. Using a novel noninvasive approach in 33 male human participants, we tracked instantaneous cortical excitability by inferring the magnitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents from the N20 component of the somatosensory evoked potential. Fluctuations of cortical excitability demonstrated long-range temporal dependencies decaying according to a power law across trials, a hallmark of systems at critical states. As these dynamics covaried with changes in prestimulus oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz), we establish a mechanistic link between ongoing and evoked activity through cortical excitability and argue that the co-emergence of common temporal power laws may indeed originate from neural networks poised close to a critical state. In contrast, no signatures of criticality were found in subcortical or peripheral nerve activity. Thus, criticality may represent a parsimonious organizing principle of variability in stimulus-related brain processes on a cortical level, possibly reflecting a delicate equilibrium between robustness and flexibility of neural responses to external stimuli. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Variability of neural responses in primary sensory areas is puzzling, as it is detrimental to the exact mapping between stimulus features and neural activity. However, such variability can be beneficial for information processing in neural networks if it is of a specific nature, namely, if dynamics are poised at a so-called critical state characterized by a scale-free spatiotemporal structure. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a link between signatures of criticality in ongoing and evoked activity through cortical excitability, which fills the long-standing gap between two major directions of research on neural variability: the impact of instantaneous brain states on stimulus processing on the one hand and the scale-free organization of spatiotemporal network dynamics of spontaneous activity on the other.",TRUE
THE Absorption of Water by Woodlice,"1. Experiments were undertaken to determine the site of water uptake, and the conditions in which it occurs, in Ligia oceanica, Oniscus asellus, Porcellio scaber and Armadillidium vulgare.2. Besides absorbing water with moist food, all four species were capable of active imbibition of water through both mouth and anus when a free water surface was available. In Ligia oceanica, imbibition occurred largely through the anus, in other species, through the mouth. Absorption through the anus was demonstrated by blocking the mouth by electro-cautery.3. All species save L. oceanica could imbibe water through the mouth from a damp surface (plaster of Paris) sufficiently rapidly to counteract the effect of transpiration from the integument in air at c. 85 % R.H. No water was absorbed through the anus in these conditions.4. The results help to resolve certain conflicting statements regarding the distribution of different species in the field. All species are for the most part ‚Äòwet living‚Äô, but they differ as regards tolerance of suboptimal conditions.",TRUE
The acacia ants revisited: convergent evolution and biogeographic context in an iconic ant/plant mutualism,"Phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses can enhance our understanding of multispecies interactions by placing the origin and evolution of such interactions in a temporal and geographical context. We use a phylogenomic approach‚Äîultraconserved element sequence capture‚Äîto investigate the evolutionary history of an iconic multispecies mutualism: Neotropical acacia ants (Pseudomyrmex ferrugineus group) and their associated Vachellia hostplants. In this system, the ants receive shelter and food from the host plant, and they aggressively defend the plant against herbivores and competing plants. We confirm the existence of two separate lineages of obligate acacia ants that convergently occupied Vachellia and evolved plant-protecting behaviour, from timid ancestors inhabiting dead twigs in rainforest. The more diverse of the two clades is inferred to have arisen in the Late Miocene in northern Mesoamerica, and subsequently expanded its range throughout much of Central America. The other lineage is estimated to have originated in southern Mesoamerica about 3 Myr later, apparently piggy-backing on the pre-existing mutualism. Initiation of the Pseudomyrmex/Vachellia interaction involved a shift in the ants from closed to open habitats, into an environment with more intense plant herbivory. Comparative studies of the two lineages of mutualists should provide insight into the essential features binding this mutualism.",TRUE
The Advantages of a Tapered Whisker,"The role of facial vibrissae (whiskers) in the behavior of terrestrial mammals is principally as a supplement or substitute for short-distance vision. Each whisker in the array functions as a mechanical transducer, conveying forces applied along the shaft to mechanoreceptors in the follicle at the whisker base. Subsequent processing of mechanoreceptor output in the trigeminal nucleus and somatosensory cortex allows high accuracy discriminations of object distance, direction, and surface texture. The whiskers of terrestrial mammals are tapered and approximately circular in cross section. We characterize the taper of whiskers in nine mammal species, measure the mechanical deflection of isolated felid whiskers, and discuss the mechanics of a single whisker under static and oscillatory deflections. We argue that a tapered whisker provides some advantages for tactile perception (as compared to a hypothetical untapered whisker), and that this may explain why the taper has been preserved during the evolution of terrestrial mammals.",TRUE
The aerodynamic effects of wing‚Äìwing interaction in flapping insect wings,"SUMMARY We employed a dynamically scaled mechanical model of the small fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Reynolds number 100‚Äì200) to investigate force enhancement due to contralateral wing interactions during stroke reversal (the `clap-and-fling'). The results suggest that lift enhancement during clap-and-fling requires an angular separation between the two wings of no more than 10‚Äì12¬∞. Within the limitations of the robotic apparatus, the clap-and-fling augmented total lift production by up to 17%, but depended strongly on stroke kinematics. The time course of the interaction between the wings was quite complex. For example, wing interaction attenuated total force during the initial part of the wing clap, but slightly enhanced force at the end of the clap phase. We measured two temporally transient peaks of both lift and drag enhancement during the fling phase: a prominent peak during the initial phase of the fling motion, which accounts for most of the benefit in lift production, and a smaller peak of force enhancement at the end fling when the wings started to move apart. A detailed digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) analysis during clap-and-fling showed that the most obvious effect of the bilateral `image' wing on flow occurs during the early phase of the fling, due to a strong fluid influx between the wings as they separate. The DPIV analysis revealed, moreover, that circulation induced by a leading edge vortex (LEV) during the early fling phase was smaller than predicted by inviscid two-dimensional analytical models, whereas circulation of LEV nearly matched the predictions of Weis-Fogh's inviscid model at late fling phase. In addition, the presence of the image wing presumably causes subtle modifications in both the wake capture and viscous forces. Collectively, these effects explain some of the changes in total force and lift production during the fling. Quite surprisingly, the effect of clap-and-fling is not restricted to the dorsal part of the stroke cycle but extends to the beginning of upstroke, suggesting that the presence of the image wing distorts the gross wake structure throughout the stroke cycle.",TRUE
The aerodynamics of insect flight,"The flight of insects has fascinated physicists and biologists for more than a century. Yet, until recently, researchers were unable to rigorously quantify the complex wing motions of flapping insects or measure the forces and flows around their wings. However, recent developments in high-speed videography and tools for computational and mechanical modeling have allowed researchers to make rapid progress in advancing our understanding of insect flight. These mechanical and computational fluid dynamic models, combined with modern flow visualization techniques, have revealed that the fluid dynamic phenomena underlying flapping flight are different from those of non-flapping, 2-D wings on which most previous models were based. In particular, even at high angles of attack, a prominent leading edge vortex remains stably attached on the insect wing and does not shed into an unsteady wake, as would be expected from non-flapping 2-D wings. Its presence greatly enhances the forces generated by the wing, thus enabling insects to hover or maneuver. In addition, flight forces are further enhanced by other mechanisms acting during changes in angle of attack, especially at stroke reversal, the mutual interaction of the two wings at dorsal stroke reversal or wing-wake interactions following stroke reversal. This progress has enabled the development of simple analytical and empirical models that allow us to calculate the instantaneous forces on flapping insect wings more accurately than was previously possible. It also promises to foster new and exciting multi-disciplinary collaborations between physicists who seek to explain the phenomenology, biologists who seek to understand its relevance to insect physiology and evolution, and engineers who are inspired to build micro-robotic insects using these principles. This review covers the basic physical principles underlying flapping flight in insects, results of recent experiments concerning the aerodynamics of insect flight, as well as the different approaches used to model these phenomena.",TRUE
The Anatomy and Histology of Caudal Autotomy and Regeneration in Lizards*,"Caudal autotomy‚Äîthe ability to self-detach the tail‚Äîis a dramatic adaptation common to many structural-grade lizards. For most species, tail loss is followed by the equally dramatic phenomenon of tail regeneration. Here we review the anatomy and histology of caudal autotomy and regeneration in lizards, drawing heavily from research published over the past 2 decades. The autotomous tail is characterized by various structural adaptations, which act to minimize blood loss and trauma to adjacent tissues. The early phase of wound healing involves a leukocytic response but limited inflammation. Reepithelialization via a specialized wound epithelium is not only critical for scar-free healing but also necessary for subsequent tissue patterning and regenerative outgrowth. Regeneration begins with the formation of the blastema, a mass of proliferating mesenchymal-like cells. As the blastema expands, it is invaded by blood vessels and the spinal cord. Whereas the replacement tail outwardly resembles the original appendage, it differs in several notable respects, including the tissue composition and organization of the skeleton, muscular system, and spinal cord. Increasingly, the lizard tail is being recognized among biomedical scientists as an important model for the study of wound healing and multitissue restoration.",TRUE
The Ancient Chemistry of Avoiding Risks of Predation and Disease,"Illness, death, and costs of immunity and injury strongly select for avoidance of predators or contagion. Ants, cockroaches, and collembola recognize their dead using unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., oleic or linoleic acid) as ‚Äúnecromone‚Äù cues. Ants, bees, and termites remove dead from their nests (necrophoric behavior) whereas semi-social species seal off corpses or simply avoid their dead or injured (necrophobic behavior). Alarm and avoidance responses to exudates from injured conspecifics are widespread. This involves diverse pheromones, complex chemistry and learning. We hypothesized that necromones are a phylogenetically ancient class of related signals and predicted that terrestrial Isopoda (that strongly aggregate and lack known dispersants) would avoid body fluids and corpses using fatty acid ‚Äúnecromones.‚Äù Isopods were repelled by crushed conspecifics (blood), intact corpses, and alcohol extracts of bodies. As predicted, the repellent fraction contained oleic and linoleic acids and authentic standards repelled several isopod species. We further predicted a priori that social caterpillars (lacking known dispersants) would be repelled by their own body fluids and unsaturated fatty acids. Both tent caterpillars and fall webworms avoided branches treated with conspecific body fluid. Oleic and linoleic acids were also strongly avoided by both species. Necromone signaling appears widespread and likely traces to aquatic ancestors pre-dating the divergence of the Crustacea and Hexapoda at least 420 million years ago.",TRUE
The attachment strategy of English ivy: a complex mechanism acting on several hierarchical levels,"English ivy (Hedera helix L.) is able to grow on vertical substrates such as trees, rocks and house plaster, thereby attaching so firmly to the surface that when removed by force typically whole pieces of the climbing substrate are torn off. The structural details of the attachment process are not yet entirely understood. We studied the attachment process of English ivy in detail and suggest a four-phase process to describe the attachment strategy: (i) initial physical contact, (ii) form closure of the root with the substrate, (iii) chemical adhesion, and (iv) shape changes of the root hairs and form-closure with the substrate. These four phases and their variations play an important role in the attachment to differently structured surfaces. We demonstrate that, in English ivy, different mechanisms work together to allow the plant's attachment to various climbing substrates and reveal the importance of micro-fibril orientation in the root hairs for the attachment based on structural changes at the subcellular level.",TRUE
The Balance between Actomyosin Contractility and Microtubule Polymerization Regulates Hierarchical Protrusions That Govern Efficient Fibroblast-Collagen Interactions.,"Fibroblasts undergo a critical transformation from an initially inactive state to a morphologically different and contractile state after several hours of being embedded within a physiologically relevant three-dimensional (3D) fibrous collagen-based extracellular matrix (ECM). However, little is known about the critical mechanisms by which fibroblasts adapt themselves and their microenvironment in the earliest stage of cell-matrix interaction. Here, we identified the mechanisms by which fibroblasts interact with their 3D collagen fibrous matrices in the early stages of cell-matrix interaction and showed that fibroblasts use energetically efficient hierarchical micro/nano scaled protrusions in these stages as the primary means for the transformation and adaptation. We found that actomyosin contractility in these protrusions in the early stages of cell-matrix interaction restricts the growth of microtubules by applying compressive forces on them. Our results show that actomyosin contractility and microtubules work in concert in the early stages of cell-matrix interaction to adapt fibroblasts and their microenvironment to one another. These early-stage interactions result in responses to disruption of the microtubule network and/or actomyosin contractility that are opposite to well-known responses to late-stage disruption, and reveal insight into the ways that cells adapt themselves and their ECM recursively.",TRUE
The basics and underlying mechanisms of mucoadhesion.,"Mucoadhesion is where two surfaces, one of which is a mucous membrane, adhere to each other. This has been of interest in the pharmaceutical sciences in order to enhance localised drug delivery, or to deliver 'difficult' molecules (proteins and oligonucleotides) into the systemic circulation. Mucoadhesive materials are hydrophilic macromolecules containing numerous hydrogen bond forming groups, the carbomers and chitosans being two well-known examples. The mechanism by which mucoadhesion takes place has been said to have two stages, the contact (wetting) stage followed by the consolidation stage (the establishment of the adhesive interactions). The relative importance of each stage will depend on the individual application. For example, adsorption is a key stage if the dosage form cannot be applied directly to the mucosa of interest, while consolidation is important if the formulation is exposed to significant dislodging stresses. Adhesive joint failure will inevitably occur as a result of overhydration of a dosage form, or as a result of epithelia or mucus turnover. New mucoadhesive materials with optimal adhesive properties are now being developed, and these should enhance the potential applications of this technology.",TRUE
The biology and ecology of the ocean sunfish Mola mola: a review of current knowledge and future research perspectives,"Relatively little is known about the biology and ecology of the world‚Äôs largest (heaviest) bony fish, the ocean sunfish Mola mola, despite its worldwide occurrence in temperate and tropical seas. Studies are now emerging that require many common perceptions about sunfish behaviour and ecology to be re-examined. Indeed, the long-held view that ocean sunfish are an inactive, passively drifting species seems to be entirely misplaced. Technological advances in marine telemetry are revealing distinct behavioural patterns and protracted seasonal movements. Extensive forays by ocean sunfish into the deep ocean have been documented and broad-scale surveys, together with molecular and laboratory based techniques, are addressing the connectivity and trophic role of these animals. These emerging molecular and movement studies suggest that local distinct populations may be prone to depletion through bycatch in commercial fisheries. Rising interest in ocean sunfish, highlighted by the increase in recent publications, warrants a thorough review of the biology and ecology of this species. Here we review the taxonomy, morphology, geography, diet, locomotion, vision, movements, foraging ecology, reproduction and species interactions of M. mola. We present a summary of current conservation issues and suggest methods for addressing fundamental gaps in our knowledge.",TRUE
The biology of extinct and extant sawfish (Batoidea: Sclerorhynchidae and Pristidae),"Sclerorhynchids (extinct sawfishes, Batoidea), pristids (extant sawfish, Batoidea) and pristiophorids (sawsharks, Squalomorphi) are the three elasmobranch families that possess an elongated rostrum with lateral teeth. Sclerorhynchids are the extinct sawfishes of the Cretaceous period, which reached maximum total lengths of 100¬†cm. The morphology of their rostral teeth is highly variable. Pristid sawfish occur circumtropically and can reach maximum total lengths of around 700¬†cm. All pristid species are globally endangered due to their restricted habitat inshore. Pristiophorid sawsharks are small sharks of maximum total lengths below 150¬†cm, which occur in depths of 70‚Äì900¬†m. Close examination of the morphology of pectoral fin basals and the internal structure of the rostrum reveals that sclerorhynchids and pristids evolved independently from rhinobatids, whereas pristiophorids are squalomorph sharks. The elongation of the rostrum may be an adaptation for feeding, as all marine vertebrate taxa that possess this structure are said to use it in the context of feeding.",TRUE
"THE CALCAREOUS EGG CAPSULE OF THE PATAGONIAN NEOGASTROPOD ODONTOCYMBIOLA MAGELLANICA: MORPHOLOGY, SECRETION AND MINERALOGY","Odontocymbiola magellanica is the only known South American volutid gastropod that deposits calcareous egg capsules. The spawn is moulded and fixed to flat or convex surfaces by the female‚Äôs ventral pedal gland, during an hours-long process in which the female adopts a stereotyped posture and appears nonreactive to most external stimuli. Microscopically, the different cells of the ventral pedal gland show features suggesting their participation in the secretion of both the organic matrix and the calcium component of the calcareous layer. The latter consists mainly of numerous spherspherulites that are packed together around cylindrical, septated spaces which traverse the spherspherulitic layer and attach to the membranous layers surrounding the capsule cavity. These septated spaces should ensure permeability of the capsule wall, which is necessary for gas exchange and excretion by the embryo. The calcareous layer is made of high-magnesium calcite, a calcium carbonate polymorph in which Ca is partially substituted by Mg in the calcite lattice. Mg substitution is thought to confer a greater crack resistance to the mineral; it is found in many invertebrates, but apparently has not been reported before in molluscs. Odontocymbiola magellanica is a long-lived species, investing heavily in its egg capsules.",TRUE
The captured launch of a ballistospore,"Ballistospore discharge is a feature of 30000 species of mushrooms, basidiomycete yeasts and pathogenic rusts and smuts. The biomechanics of discharge may involve an abrupt change in the center of mass associated with the coalescence of Buller's drop and the spore. However this process occurs so rapidly that the launch of the ballistospore has never been visualized. Here we report ultra high-speed video recordings of the earliest events of spore dispersal using the yeast Itersonilia perplexans and the distantly related jelly fungus Auricularia auricula. Images taken at camera speeds of up to 100,000 frames/ s demonstrate that ballistospore discharge does involve the coalescence of Buller's drop and the spore. Recordings of I. perplexans demonstrate that although coalescence may result from the directed collapse of Buller's drop onto the spore, it also may involve the movement of the spore toward the drop. The release of surface tension at coalescence provides the energy and directional momentum to propel the drop and spore away from the fungus. Analyses show that ballistospores launch into the air at initial accelerations in excess of 10,000 g. There is no known analog of this micromechanical process in animals, plants or bacteria, but the recent development of a surface tension motor may mimic the fungal biology described here.",TRUE
The Ccr4-Not complex monitors the translating ribosome for codon optimality,"Coupling translation and mRNA decay Gene expression requires messenger RNAs (mRNAs)‚ÄîDNA-derived blueprints of genes‚Äîto be translated by protein-producing ribosomes. The levels of mRNAs are tightly regulated, in part by controlling their half-lives. In eukaryotic cells, mRNA half-life is largely linked to translational efficiency, but the mechanism underlying this link has remained elusive. Buschauer et al. used cryo‚Äìelectron microscopy and RNA sequencing to show how a key regulator of mRNA degradation, the Ccr4-Not complex, monitors the ribosome during mRNA translation. They found that the Not5 subunit directly binds to a ribosomal site exposed specifically during inefficient decoding, thereby triggering mRNA degradation. Analysis of mutants revealed the importance of this sensing mechanism for mRNA homeostasis. Science, this issue p. eaay6912 A protein complex binds to ribosomes that lack bound tRNAs, thus connecting translation elongation problems and mRNA decay. INTRODUCTION The tightly controlled process of gene expression requires messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which represent DNA-derived blueprints for polypeptides, to be translated by the protein-producing machinery of the cell, the ribosomes. Therefore, protein levels depend largely on cellular mRNA levels, and the control of mRNA decay is one of the most critical processes for setting the overall level of gene expression. Half-lives of mRNAs vary greatly between different transcripts, and regulation of the mRNA decay rate is intimately connected to the elongation phase of mRNA translation. To that end, codon optimality has been established as a key parameter for determining mRNA half-life in multiple eukaryotic organisms. It has also been established that the timely decay of short-lived mRNAs enriched with nonoptimal codons requires the Ccr4-Not complex. Ccr4-Not is an essential protein complex, with its best understood role in mRNA degradation, where it serves as the major cytoplasmic 3‚Ä≤-poly(A)-tail deadenylase that initiates decay of most mRNAs. By deadenylation and subsequent activation of the mRNA decapping machinery, the Ccr4-Not complex renders mRNAs accessible to the major degrading exonucleases, such as Xrn1 on the 5‚Ä≤ end and the exosome on the 3‚Ä≤ end. The molecular mechanism underlying codon optimality monitoring and coordination with mRNA decay by the Ccr4-Not complex has remained elusive. RATIONALE Because nonoptimal codons affect decoding kinetics of the ribosome and mRNA degradation occurs largely cotranslationally, it is highly plausible that codon optimality is directly monitored on the ribosome. In addition, a direct physical link between the participating Ccr4-Not complex and the ribosome has been suggested previously, and the Not4 subunit of the complex, an E3 ligase, ubiquitinates the eS7 protein of the 40S ribosomal subunit in yeast. Therefore, we set out to gain insights into the connection between the Ccr4-Not complex and the translation machinery in the context of mRNA homeostasis by combining cryo‚Äìelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), ribosome profiling, and biochemical analysis. RESULTS We used affinity-purified native Ccr4-Not‚Äìribosome complexes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae for analysis by cryo-EM and found that recruitment of Ccr4-Not to the ribosome occurs via the Not5 subunit. The N terminus of Not5‚Äîin particular, a three Œ±-helix bundle‚Äîinteracted specifically with the ribosomal E-site, and deletion of the Not5 N-terminus resulted in the loss of stable ribosome association of the Ccr4-Not complex. However, ubiquitination of the small ribosomal subunit protein eS7 through the Not4 subunit still occurred. The Not5 interaction involved the ribosomal protein eS25 of the small subunit, in addition to transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). We found that Ccr4-Not interacts with both initiating and elongating ribosomes. In either case, Not5 engaged the E-site only when the ribosome adopted a distinct conformation lacking accommodated tRNA in the A-site, indicative of impaired decoding kinetics. Ribosome profiling revealed that low-optimality codons were enriched in the A-site in the Ccr4-Not‚Äìbound elongating ribosomes. This observation explained the low A-site tRNA occupancy observed with cryo-EM and suggested a link to codon optimality monitoring. Consistently, using mRNA stability assays, we found that loss of Not5 resulted in the inability of the mRNA degradation machinery to sense codon optimality. The observed dysregulation of mRNA half-life was detected upon Not5 deletion, Not5 N-terminal deletion, eS25 deletion, and loss of eS7 ubiquitination by Not4, which apparently serves as an upstream prerequisite for further Ccr4-Not activity on the ribosome. In addition, mRNA decapping was found to be impaired in these mutants, which confirmed that, in this pathway, Ccr4-Not triggers decapping downstream of optimality monitoring. CONCLUSION Our analysis elucidates a direct physical link between the mRNA decay‚Äìmediating Ccr4-Not complex and the ribosome. Dependent on preceding ubiquitination of eS7 by the Not4 subunit, the Ccr4-Not complex binds (via the Not5 subunit) specifically to the ribosomal E-site when the A-site lacks tRNA because of slow decoding kinetics. This state of the ribosome occurs in the presence of nonoptimal codons in the A-site, which explains the shorter half-lives of transcripts enriched in nonoptimal codons. Thus, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the coordination of translation efficiency with mRNA stability through the Ccr4-Not complex. Ccr4-Not couples translation efficiency to mRNA degradation. When ribosomes encounter nonoptimal codons, low decoding efficiency leads to an increased likelihood of dissociation of the E-site tRNA before the cognate tRNA is accommodated in the A-site. As a result, the ribosomal E-site adopts a specific conformation, which is recognized by the Ccr4-Not complex through the N-terminus of its Not5 subunit, eventually triggering mRNA degradation by Xrn1. Control of messenger RNA (mRNA) decay rate is intimately connected to translation elongation, but the spatial coordination of these events is poorly understood. The Ccr4-Not complex initiates mRNA decay through deadenylation and activation of decapping. We used a combination of cryo‚Äìelectron microscopy, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays to examine the recruitment of Ccr4-Not to the ribosome via specific interaction of the Not5 subunit with the ribosomal E-site in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This interaction occurred when the ribosome lacked accommodated A-site transfer RNA, indicative of low codon optimality. Loss of the interaction resulted in the inability of the mRNA degradation machinery to sense codon optimality. Our findings elucidate a physical link between the Ccr4-Not complex and the ribosome and provide mechanistic insight into the coupling of decoding efficiency with mRNA stability.",TRUE
The central role of Clark's nutcracker in the dispersal and establishment of whitebark pine,"Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) is known to have its seeds harvested and cached in the soil by Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), and unretrieved seeds are known to be capable of germinating and establishing new pines. Many other vertebrates also harvest and feed on these seeds, however, and the roles of these animals as dispersers and establishers of whitebark pine has been uncertain. This work demonstrates that birds other than the nutcracker, rodents, and other mammals do not have the requisite behaviors to systematically disperse or establish whitebark pine, and that the pine is therefore dependent on the nutcracker for its regeneration. These findings support previous suggestions that Clark's Nutcracker is a specialized frugivore that has profoundly influenced the ecology and the evolution of whitebark pine.",TRUE
The contribution of mineral to the material properties of vertebral cartilage from the smooth-hound shark Mustelus californicus,"SUMMARY Elasmobranch vertebral cartilage has a substantial mineral fraction (39‚Äì55%) and the arrangement of mineral varies among species. We examined vertebrae from one shark species, Mustelus californicus, to determine mineral content, the effect of mineral on material properties and the viscoelastic response of vertebral cartilage. We serially demineralized vertebrae and compressively tested them to failure at varying strain rates. Mineral in vertebral cartilage varies within individuals, intraspecifically and interspecifically; this is in contrast to bone, in which significant variation in mineral content is pathological or an interspecific effect. Within Mustelus, vertebrae with larger mineral fractions were significantly stiffer and stronger; however when variation is assessed across species, the structure has a larger effect. Shark vertebral cartilage did not show a substantial viscoelastic response at biologically relevant strain rates, validating the use of quasistatic testing for this material.",TRUE
"The contribution of nasal countercurrent heat exchange to water balance in the northern elephant seal, Mirounga angustirostris","Elephant seals fast completely from food and water for 1‚Äì3 months during terrestrial breeding. Temporal countercurrent heat exchange in the nasal passage reduces expired air temperature (Te) below body temperature (Tb). At a mean ambient temperature of 13.7 degrees C, Te is 20.9 degrees C. This results in the recovery of 71.5% of the water added to inspired air. The amount of cooling of the expired air (Tb - Te) and the percentage of water recovery varies inversely with ambient temperature. Total nasal surface area available for heat and water exchange, located in the highly convoluted nasal turbinates, is estimated to be 720 cm2 in weaned pups and 3140 cm2 in an adult male. Nasal temporal countercurrent heat exchange reduces total water loss sufficiently to allow maintenance of water balance using metabolic water production alone.",TRUE
The Cyanophage Molecular Mixing Bowl of Photosynthesis Genes,"Among the wealth of microbial organisms inhabiting marine environments, cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are the most abundant photosynthetic cells. Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, the two most common cyanobacteria, account for 30% of global carbon fixation (through the photosynthetic process in which sugars are manufactured from carbon dioxide and water). By drawing on natural resources, these microbes use photosystems (PS) I and II (the two reaction centers in photosynthesis) to harness energy.  Intriguingly, some viruses that infect cyanobacteria (called cyanophage), carry genes that encode two PSII core reaction-center proteins: PsbA (the most rapidly turned over core protein in all oxygen-yielding photosynthetic organisms) and PsbD (which forms a complex with PsbA). By expressing their own copies of psbA and psbD during infection, these cyanophages have managed to co-opt host genes to suit their own purposes: enhancing photosynthesis. It seems likely that they do this in the interests of their own fitness, since cyanophage production is optimal when photosynthesis is maintained during infection.  Until recently, only a small sample of cyanophages had been examined, leaving open the questions of how widespread PSII genes are in these organisms and where the genes came from. To answer these questions, Matthew Sullivan, Debbie Lindell, Sallie Chisholm, and colleagues examined a pool of 33 cyanophage isolates (cultured from samples collected from the Sargasso Sea and the Red Sea), along with data already available for nine other cyanophages, for the presence of psbA and psbD genes. They found psbA was present in 88% and psbD in 50% of the cyanophages studied. By analyzing the sequences of these genes along with those from Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus host genes, they reconstructed the evolutionary history of how the PSII genes entered the phage genomes.  Cyanophages are divided morphologically into three main families (Podoviridae, Myoviridae, and Siphoviridae). Looking at the distributions of the PSII genes across the different families, Sullivan, Lindell, et al. saw that psbA was present in all myoviruses and all Prochlorococcus podoviruses, but not in Prochlorococcus siphoviruses or Synechococcus podoviruses. The high levels of sequence conservation between the different cyanophages suggest that this gene is probably functional and that it is likely to increase the reproductive fitness of the phage. The length of the latent period may impact the distribution pattern of psbA among these phage groups. However, more information about the physiological characteristics of cyanophages is needed to further investigate these possibilities.  The second gene, psbD, was less prolific but was seen in four of the 20 Prochlorococcus myoviruses and 17 of the 20 Synechococcus myoviruses examined‚Äîall of which also encoded psbA. Myoviruses are known to infect a wider range of cyanobacteria than the other cyanophage families. Indeed, when investigated, the psbD-encoding myoviruses correlated with those known to have a broader host range. Perhaps the co-opting of both PSII genes ensures a functional PsbA‚ÄìPsbD protein complex to enhance infection for these cyanophages that are able to infect a wider range of hosts.  To determine when the PSII genes had been transferred into the phage and from where, Sullivan, Lindell, et al. investigated the nucleotide sequences of psbA and psbD from both Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus host and cyanophage. Using meticulous sequence analyses and standard statistical methods, they generated phylogenetic trees to explain the evolutionary history of these two PSII genes.  By analyzing the clusters of sequence types within the resulting tree, the authors saw evidence that psbA was transferred from the cyanobacteria host genome into the phage genome on four independent occasions and two separate occasions for psbD. Exchange events were generally host-range specific, meaning that Prochlorococcus genes transferred to Prochlorococcus phages, and so on. However, a few intriguing exceptions, where genes did not cluster with their hosts, were observed; these might result from genetic exchange between members of two different phage families (one of broader host range) during co-infection of the same host.  Sullivan, Lindell, et al. were also able to use their dataset to investigate a previous suggestion that alterations in the nucleotide distributions within individual PSII genes (creating a kind of patchwork gene) demonstrate that intragenic recombination has taken place. Indeed, they confirm that this occurs among Synechococcus myoviruses and Prochlorococcus podoviruses. In some cases involving Synechococcus, intragenic recombination appears to have happened in both host-to-phage and phage-to-host directions for both genes; and, for some Prochlorococcus genes, DNA from an unknown source also seems to have been inserted. Occasionally, intragenic exchanges are also seen between Synechococcus hosts.  The authors compare their cultured results to those from wild phage sequences from the Pacific Ocean and see that much of the natural diversity is similar to the sequences from the cyanophage isolates, despite their origination from different ocean basins. Overall, therefore, a considerable amount of genetic shuffling takes place within these two PSII genes in cyanophages, and this creates a reservoir of photosynthetic diversity from which both host and phage are likely to benefit. This study offers a compelling example of global-scale microbial and phage co-evolution that likely influences the biological success of these prolific marine organisms.",TRUE
The design of soft collagenous load-bearing tissues,"Tendon, articular cartilage and the human heel pad are all soft load-bearing collagenous tissues but are designed according to utterly different micromechanical principles. Tendon is (probably) a fibre-reinforced composite material. The mechanical properties of cartilage depend on osmotic pressure developed within an aqueous proteoglycan gel and resisted by tension in a collagenous network. The micromechanics of the heel pad have not previously been described quantitatively. Order-of-magnitude calculations are introduced to assess a model based on a fluid-filled cushion. The processes of biological design are illustrated by considering tendon. Structural design determines the tendon's cross-sectional area relative to that of its muscle and, hence, the maximum stress to which the tendon may be subjected in life. Stress-in-life varies widely between tendons. Material design includes the development of compressive stiffness in the regions where transverse loads arise. More generally, the fatigue quality of each tendon is adjusted to suit its stress-in-life. The correlation between fatigue quality and stress-in-life means that every tendon is subject, on average, to a comparable rate of fatigue damage. Homeostasis requires that routine repair can keep up with this rate of damage.",TRUE
The detection of carbonation by the Drosophila gustatory system,"There are five known taste modalities in humans: sweet, bitter, sour, salty and umami (the taste of monosodium glutamate). Although the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster tastes sugars, salts and noxious chemicals, the nature and number of taste modalities in this organism is not clear. Previous studies have identified one taste cell population marked by the gustatory receptor gene Gr5a that detects sugars, and a second population marked by Gr66a that detects bitter compounds. Here we identify a novel taste modality in this insect: the taste of carbonated water. We use a combination of anatomical, calcium imaging and behavioural approaches to identify a population of taste neurons that detects CO2 and mediates taste acceptance behaviour. The taste of carbonation may allow Drosophila to detect and obtain nutrients from growing microorganisms. Whereas CO2 detection by the olfactory system mediates avoidance, CO2 detection by the gustatory system mediates acceptance behaviour, demonstrating that the context of CO2 determines appropriate behaviour. This work opens up the possibility that the taste of carbonation may also exist in other organisms.",TRUE
The diversity of hydrostatic skeletons,"Summary A remarkably diverse group of organisms rely on a hydrostatic skeleton for support, movement, muscular antagonism and the amplification of the force and displacement of muscle contraction. In hydrostatic skeletons, force is transmitted not through rigid skeletal elements but instead by internal pressure. Functioning of these systems depends on the fact that they are essentially constant in volume as they consist of relatively incompressible fluids and tissue. Contraction of muscle and the resulting decrease in one of the dimensions thus results in an increase in another dimension. By actively (with muscle) or passively (with connective tissue) controlling the various dimensions, a wide array of deformations, movements and changes in stiffness can be created. An amazing range of animals and animal structures rely on this form of skeletal support, including anemones and other polyps, the extremely diverse wormlike invertebrates, the tube feet of echinoderms, mammalian and turtle penises, the feet of burrowing bivalves and snails, and the legs of spiders. In addition, there are structures such as the arms and tentacles of cephalopods, the tongue of mammals and the trunk of the elephant that also rely on hydrostatic skeletal support but lack the fluid-filled cavities that characterize this skeletal type. Although we normally consider arthropods to rely on a rigid exoskeleton, a hydrostatic skeleton provides skeletal support immediately following molting and also during the larval stage for many insects. Thus, the majority of animals on earth rely on hydrostatic skeletons.",TRUE
The diving bell and the spider: the physical gill of Argyroneta aquatica,"SUMMARY Argyroneta aquatica is a unique air-breathing spider that lives virtually its entire life under freshwater. It creates a dome-shaped web between aquatic plants and fills the diving bell with air carried from the surface. The bell can take up dissolved O2 from the water, acting as a ‚Äòphysical gill‚Äô. By measuring bell volume and O2 partial pressure (PO2) with tiny O2-sensitive optodes, this study showed that the spiders produce physical gills capable of satisfying at least their resting requirements for O2 under the most extreme conditions of warm stagnant water. Larger spiders produced larger bells of higher O2 conductance (GO2). GO2 depended on surface area only; effective boundary layer thickness was constant. Bells, with and without spiders, were used as respirometers by measuring GO2 and the rate of change in PO2. Metabolic rates were also measured with flow-through respirometry. The water‚Äìair PO2 difference was generally less than 10 kPa, and spiders voluntarily tolerated low internal PO2 approximately 1‚Äì4 kPa before renewal with air from the surface.

The Dry-Style Antifogging Properties of Mosquito Compound Eyes and Artificial Analogues Prepared by Soft Lithography‚Ä†,"Fogging occurs when moisture condensation takes the form of accumulated droplets with diameters larger than 190 nm or half of the shortest wavelength (380 nm) of visible light. This problem may be effectively addressed by changing the affinity of a material‚Äôs surface for water, which can be accomplished via two approaches: i) the superhydrophilic approach, with a water contact angle (CA) less than 5¬∞, and ii) the superhydrophobic approach, with a water CA greater than 150¬∞, and extremely low CA hysteresis. To date, all techniques reported belong to the former category, as they are intended for applications in optical transparent coatings. A well-known example is the use of photocatalytic TiO2 nanoparticle coatings that become superhydrophilic under UV irradiation. Very recently, a capillary effect was skillfully adopted to achieve superhydrophilic properties by constructing 3D nanoporous structures from layer-by-layer assembled nanoparticles. The key to these two ‚Äúwet‚Äù-style antifogging strategies is for micrometer-sized fog drops to rapidly spread into a uniform thin film, which can prevent light scattering and reflection from nucleated droplets. Optical transparency is not an intrinsic property of antifogging coatings even though recently developed antifogging coatings are almost transparent, and the transparency could be achieved by further tuning the nanoparticle size and film thickness. To our knowledge, the antifogging coatings may also be applied to many fields that do not require optical transparency, including, for example, paints for inhibiting swelling and peeling issues and metal surfaces for preventing corrosion. These types of issues, which are caused by adsorption of moisture, are hard to solve by the superhydrophilic approach because of its inherently ‚Äúwet‚Äù nature. Thus, a ‚Äúdry‚Äù-style antifogging strategy, which consists of a novel superhydrophobic technique that can prevent moisture or microscale fog drops from nucleating on a surface, is desired. Recent bionic researches have revealed that the self-cleaning ability of lotus leaves and the striking ability of a water-strider‚Äôs legs to walk on water can be attributed to the ideal superhydrophobicity of their surfaces, induced by special microand nanostructures. To date, the biomimetic fabrication of superhydrophobic microand/or nanostructures has attracted considerable interest, and these types of materials can be used for such applications as self-cleaning coatings and stain-resistant textiles. Although a superhydrophobic technique inspired by lotus leaves is expected to be able to solve such fogging problems because the water droplets can not remain on the surface, there are no reports of such antifogging coatings. Very recently, researchers from General Motors have reported that the surfaces of lotus leaves become wet with moisture because the size of the fog drops are at the microscale‚Äîso small that they can be easily trapped in the interspaces among micropapillae. Thus, lotuslike surface microstructures are unsuitable for superhydrophobic antifogging coatings, and a new inspiration from nature is desired for solving this problem. In this communication, we report a novel, biological, superhydrophobic antifogging strategy. It was found that the compound eyes of the mosquito C. pipiens possess ideal superhydrophobic properties that provide an effective protective mechanism for maintaining clear vision in a humid habitat. Our research indicates that this unique property is attributed to the smart design of elaborate microand nanostructures: hexagonally non-close-packed (ncp) nipples at the nanoscale prevent microscale fog drops from condensing on the ommatidia surface, and hexagonally close-packed (hcp) ommatidia at the microscale could efficiently prevent fog drops from being trapped in the voids between the ommatidia. We also fabricated artificial compound eyes by using soft lithography and investigated the effects of microand nanostructures on the surface hydrophobicity. These findings could be used to develop novel superhydrophobic antifogging coatings in the near future. It is known that mosquitoes possess excellent vision, which they exploit to locate various resources such as mates, hosts, and resting sites in a watery and dim habitat. To better understand such remarkable abilities, we first investigated the interaction between moisture and the eye surface. An ultrasonic humidifier was used to regulate the relative humidity of the atmosphere and mimic a mist composed of numerous tiny water droplets with diameters less than 10 lm.

The echinoderm collagen fibril: a hero in the connective tissue research of the 1990s,"Collagen fibrils are some of the most‚Äêabundant and important extracellular structures in our bodies, yet we are unsure of their shape and size. This is largely due to an inherent difficulty in isolating them from their surrounding tissues. Echinoderms have collagenous tissues that are similar to ours in many ways, yet they can be manipulated to easily relinquish their collagen fibrils, providing an excellent opportunity to study native fibrillar structure. In the early 1990s, they were found to defy the commonly accepted fibrillar model of the time in that they were much shorter, they were shaped like double‚Äêended spindles, and their centers exhibited a reversal in molecular polarity. Realization of these features helped to reform the questions that were being asked about vertebrate fibrils, shifting the focus toward shape and size. Since then, researchers working with both groups (echinoderms and vertebrates) have worked together to find the structure of native fibrils. This information will be fundamental in understanding what holds collagenous tissues together at the fibrillar level, and could have important implications for people with Ehlers‚ÄêDanlos syndrome.

The effect of individual variation on the structure and function of interaction networks in harvester ants,"Social insects exhibit coordinated behaviour without central control. Local interactions among individuals determine their behaviour and regulate the activity of the colony. Harvester ants are recruited for outside work, using networks of brief antennal contacts, in the nest chamber closest to the nest exit: the entrance chamber. Here, we combine empirical observations, image analysis and computer simulations to investigate the structure and function of the interaction network in the entrance chamber. Ant interactions were distributed heterogeneously in the chamber, with an interaction hot-spot at the entrance leading further into the nest. The distribution of the total interactions per ant followed a right-skewed distribution, indicating the presence of highly connected individuals. Numbers of ant encounters observed positively correlated with the duration of observation. Individuals varied in interaction frequency, even after accounting for the duration of observation. An ant's interaction frequency was explained by its path shape and location within the entrance chamber. Computer simulations demonstrate that variation among individuals in connectivity accelerates information flow to an extent equivalent to an increase in the total number of interactions. Individual variation in connectivity, arising from variation among ants in location and spatial behaviour, creates interaction centres, which may expedite information flow.",TRUE
The effect of molluscan glue proteins on gel mechanics,"SUMMARY Several molluscs have been shown to alternate between a non-adhesive trail mucus and a similar gel that forms a strong glue. The major structural difference between the two secretions is the presence of specific proteins in the adhesive mucus. The present study identifies similar proteins from the glue of the slug Arion subfuscus and the land snail Helix aspersa. To investigate the role played by these proteins in adhesion, the proteins were isolated from the adhesive mucus of different molluscs and added to commercial polymer solutions. The effect was observed qualitatively, and quantified using a dynamic rheometer. The isolated proteins triggered gelling or visible stiffening of agar, pectin and polygalacturonic acid. The effect was stronger on more negatively charged polymers. The effect of the proteins was concentration dependent with an optimal concentration of 1‚Äì1.5 mg ml‚Äì1, and was weakened when their structure changed. Other proteins and carbohydrates found in the adhesive mucus had no clear mechanical effect on gels. These findings show that the addition of these proteins to large, anionic polymers plays a central role in the formation of a glue from a mucus-like secretion. Such a mechanism may be common among invertebrates, and it may guide biomimetic approaches in the development of glues and gels.",TRUE
The energetics of the jump of the locust Schistocerca gregaria,"The anatomy of the metathoracic leg is redescribed with particular reference to storage of energy in cuticular elements and the way in which the stored energy is used in jumping. The jump of adult male locusts requires an energy of 9 mJ and that of the female requires 11 mJ. The semilunar processes of each metafemur store 4 mJ at a stress of 15 N, and the extensor tibiae apodeme stores a further 3 mJ at the same stress. The total stored energy in both metathoracic legs is 14 mJ. The extensor tibiae muscle produces a maximum isometric force of over 15 N at 30 degrees C and, when loaded with the extensor apodeme and semilunar processes, attains this force in 0.3 sec with a strain of 0.8 mm. The peak power output is 36 mW or 0.45 W.g-1. The peak isometric force is attained when the tibia is fully flexed and the force falls as the tibia extends. The extensor tibiae muscle A band is 5.5 mum long and the peak force is over 0.75 N.m-2. The peak velocity of shortening is 7 mm.sec-1 or about 1.75 lengths/sec at 30 degrees C. The tensile strength of the extensor apodeme is 0.6 kN.mm-2 and Young's modulus is 19 kN.mm-2. The safety factor does not exceed 1.2 and the safety factor of the semilunar processes and tibial cuticle is little higher. The jump impulse lasts 25-30 msec. A velocity of 3.2 m.sec-1 is reached after a peak acceleration of 180 m.sec-2. The peak power output is 0.75 W at close to maximum velocity. Energy losses in rotating the femur and tibia are small and it is shown that the leg is able to extend at 7 times the normal rate with losses of about 20%. Most of the stored energy is converted to kinetic energy as the animal jumps. A model is based on the relaxation of a spring that has the properties of the elastic elements of the locust leg into a lever with the same kinematics as the locust leg produces a force-distance curve similar to that measured for locust jumps. The major part of the jump energy is stored before the jump.",TRUE
The evolution of sweat glands,"Mammals have two kinds of sweat glands, apocrine and eccrine, which provide for thermal cooling. In this paper we describe the distribution and characteristics of these glands in selected mammals, especially primates, and reject the suggested development of the eccrine gland from the apocrine gland during the Tertiary geological period. The evidence strongly suggests that the two glands, depending on the presence or absence of fur, have equal and similar functions among mammals; apocrine glands are not primitive. However, there is a unique and remarkable thermal eccrine system in humans; we suggest that this system evolved in concert with bipedalism and a smooth hairless skin.",TRUE
The eyes of oilbirds (Steatornis caripensis): pushing at the limits of sensitivity,"An extreme example of a low light-level lifestyle among flying birds is provided by the oilbird, Steatornis caripensis (Steatornithidae, Caprimulgiformes). Oilbirds breed and roost in caves, often at sufficient depth that no daylight can penetrate, and forage for fruits at night. Using standard microscopy techniques we investigated the retinal structure of oilbird eyes and used an ophthalmoscopic reflex technique to determine the parameters of these birds' visual fields. The retina is dominated by small rod receptors (diameter 1.3+/-0.2 microm; length 18.6+/-0.6 microm) arranged in a banked structure that is unique among terrestrial vertebrates. This arrangement achieves a photoreceptor density that is the highest so far recorded (approximately 1,000,000 rods mm(-2)) in any vertebrate eye. Cone photoreceptors are, however, present in low numbers. The eye is relatively small (axial length 16.1+/-0.2 mm) with a maximum pupil diameter of 9.0+/-0.0 mm, achieving a light-gathering capacity that is the highest recorded in a bird (f-number approximately 1.07). The binocular field has a maximum width of 38 degrees and extends vertically through 100 degrees with the bill projecting towards the lower periphery; a topography that suggests that vision is not used to control bill position. We propose that oilbird eyes are at one end of the continuum that juxtaposes the conflicting fundamental visual capacities of sensitivity and resolution. Thus, while oilbird visual sensitivity may be close to a maximum, visual resolution must be low. This explains why these birds employ other sensory cues, including olfaction and echolocation, in the control of their behaviour in low-light-level environments.",TRUE
The fine structure of Odonata chromatophores.,"Abstract The appearance, fine structure and pigment composition of the epidermal chromatophores of mature Austrolestes annulosus (Lestidae) are described and compared with the developing chromatophores of teneral Austrolestes and the mature chromatophores of Diphlebia lestoides (Amphipterygidae) and Ischnura heterosticta (Caenagrionidae). Mature chromatophores contain masses of near spherical light-scattering bodies and larger irregularly shaped pigment vesicles. These effect colour change by migrating in opposite directions, through a system of interconnecting granular endoplasmic reticulum tubules. The pigment, a mixture of xanthommatin and dihydroxanthommatin, has a liquid or gelatinous consistency. Developing chromatophores of teneral insects lack light-scattering bodies and well-defined migratory pigment vesicles, but contain irregular masses of pigment of similar chemical composition.",TRUE
The function of resilin in beetle wings,"This account shows the distribution of elastic elements in hind wings in the scarabaeid Pachnoda marginata and coccinellid Coccinella septempunctata (both Coleoptera). Occurrence of resilin, a rubber‚Äìlike protein, in some mobile joints together with data on wing unfolding and flight kinematics suggest that resilin in the beetle wing has multiple functions. First, the distribution pattern of resilin in the wing correlates with the particular folding pattern of the wing. Second, our data show that resilin occurs at the places where extra elasticity is needed, for example in wing folds, to prevent material damage during repeated folding and unfolding. Third, resilin provides the wing with elasticity in order to be deformable by aerodynamic forces. This may result in elastic energy storage in the wing.",TRUE
The function of terpene natural products in the natural world.,"As the largest class of natural products, terpenes have a variety of roles in mediating antagonistic and beneficial interactions among organisms. They defend many species of plants, animals and microorganisms against predators, pathogens and competitors, and they are involved in conveying messages to conspecifics and mutualists regarding the presence of food, mates and enemies. Despite the diversity of terpenes known, it is striking how phylogenetically distant organisms have come to use similar structures for common purposes. New natural roles undoubtedly remain to be discovered for this large class of compounds, given that such a small percentage of terpenes has been investigated so far.",TRUE
The functional morphology and attachment mechanism of pandarid adhesion pads (Crustacea: Copepoda: Pandaridae),"Abstract The attachment mechanism of pandarid adhesion pads is described from observations of their externally ridged structure and internal construction in three species; Pandarus bicolor Leach, 1816, Dinemoura latifolia (Steenstrup and Lutken, 1861) and Echthrogaleus coleoptratus (Guerin-Meneville, 1837). The host's external skin morphology was also examined, since parasite attachment mechanism and host surface can be considered as components of a single system. The results emphasise the importance of the physical nature of the pad's surface. This is inferred from the compliance of the cuticle and subsurface structure, and the presence of cuticular ridging. The pads probably prevent pandarids from being dislodged by hydrodynamic drag, by increasing overall adhesion. It is proposed that this is achieved in different ways, by two types of adhesion pad identified here, distinguishable by their external structure and location. Type I pads are suggested to remove interfacial water and increase surface contact by one of two contrasting methods. The ridges may act as tyre treads, by channelling water from the contact surface. Alternatively, the channels between ridges may be hydrophobic and behave as dewetting structures, preventing water from entering in the same way that troughs between surface nodules function to produce superhydrophobicity on lotus leaves. Type I adhesion pads are also suggested to aid attachment by hindering the process of peeling, by which they are thought to be removed by hydrodynamic drag. Type II pads are more likely to function as one-way frictional attachments. Both types of pad appear to be attached passively, since they lack muscles inserting into them. The adhesive mechanism of each, which functions most effectively on hard surfaces, may explain why pads are absent or reduced on pandarids which parasitise the softer, unscaled surfaces of hosts. Pandarids predominantly parasitise the skin and fins of fast-swimming sharks. This may be because the scales are characteristically smaller in these species and are more easily encircled by the primary attachment appendages, the maxillipeds. This is thought to be the first published report to reveal frictional attachment structures from the Crustacea, which have convergently evolved in many terrestrial Arthropoda.",TRUE
"The functional morphology of the petioles of the banana, Musa textilis","Bananas are among the largest herbs in the world and their lightweight petioles hold up huge leaves. This study examined how the petioles manage to achieve adequate rigidity to do this, while allowing extensive and reversible reconfiguration in high winds. Morphological and anatomical examination of the petioles and leaves of Musa textilis suggested how these two apparently incompatible abilities are achieved. The hollow U-shaped section of the petiole and the longitudinal strengthening elements in its outer skin give it adequate rigidity, while its ventral curvature help support the leaf without the need for thick lateral veins. These features, however, also allow the petiole to reconfigure by twisting away from the wind, while the leaf can fold away. In addition, two sets of internal structures, longitudinal partitions and transverse stellate parenchyma plates, help prevent dorsoventral flattening, allowing the petiole to flex further away from the wind without buckling. These ideas were tested and verified by a range of mechanical tests. Simple four-point-bending and torsion tests showed that the petioles are indeed far more compliant in torsion than in bending. Axial bending tests and crushing tests showed that petioles could be flexed twice as far and were four times as resistant to dorsoventral flattening when intact than when the internal tissue is removed. The banana petiole, therefore, seems to be an excellent example of natural integrated mechanical design.",TRUE
The geometry of the forisome-sieve element-sieve plate complex in the phloem of Vicia faba L. leaflets.,"Forisomes are contractile protein bodies that appear to control flux rates in the phloem of faboid legumes by reversibly plugging the sieve tubes. Plugging is triggered by Ca(2+) which induces an anisotropic deformation of forisomes, consisting of a longitudinal contraction and a radial expansion. By conventional light microscopy and confocal laser-scanning microscopy, the three-dimensional geometry of the forisome-sieve element-sieve plate complex in intact sieve tubes of leaflets of Vicia faba L. was reconstructed. Forisomes were mostly located close to sieve plates, and occasionally were observed drifting unrestrainedly along the sieve element, suggesting that they might be utilized as internal markers of flow direction. The diameter of forisomes in the resting state correlated with the diameter of their sieve elements, supporting the idea that radial expansion of forisomes is the geometric basis of reversible sieve tube plugging. Comparison of the present results regarding forisome geometry in situ with previously published data on forisome reactivity in vitro makes it questionable, however, whether forisomes are capable of completely sealing sieve tubes in V. faba leaves.",TRUE
The geomicrobiology of gold,"Microorganisms capable of actively solubilizing and precipitating gold appear to play a larger role in the biogeochemical cycling of gold than previously believed. Recent research suggests that bacteria and archaea are involved in every step of the biogeochemical cycle of gold, from the formation of primary mineralization in hydrothermal and deep subsurface systems to its solubilization, dispersion and re-concentration as secondary gold under surface conditions. Enzymatically catalysed precipitation of gold has been observed in thermophilic and hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea (for example, Thermotoga maritime, Pyrobaculum islandicum), and their activity led to the formation of gold- and silver-bearing sinters in New Zealand's hot spring systems. Sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB), for example, Desulfovibrio sp., may be involved in the formation of gold-bearing sulphide minerals in deep subsurface environments; over geological timescales this may contribute to the formation of economic deposits. Iron- and sulphur-oxidizing bacteria (for example, Acidothiobacillus ferrooxidans, A. thiooxidans) are known to breakdown gold-hosting sulphide minerals in zones of primary mineralization, and release associated gold in the process. These and other bacteria (for example, actinobacteria) produce thiosulphate, which is known to oxidize gold and form stable, transportable complexes. Other microbial processes, for example, excretion of amino acids and cyanide, may control gold solubilization in auriferous top- and rhizosphere soils. A number of bacteria and archaea are capable of actively catalysing the precipitation of toxic gold(I/III) complexes. Reductive precipitation of these complexes may improve survival rates of bacterial populations that are capable of (1) detoxifying the immediate cell environment by detecting, excreting and reducing gold complexes, possibly using P-type ATPase efflux pumps as well as membrane vesicles (for example, Salmonella enterica, Cupriavidus (Ralstonia) metallidurans, Plectonema boryanum); (2) gaining metabolic energy by utilizing gold-complexing ligands (for example, thiosulphate by A. ferrooxidans) or (3) using gold as metal centre in enzymes (Micrococcus luteus). C. metallidurans containing biofilms were detected on gold grains from two Australian sites, indicating that gold bioaccumulation may lead to gold biomineralization by forming secondary ‚Äòbacterioform‚Äô gold. Formation of secondary octahedral gold crystals from gold(III) chloride solution, was promoted by a cyanobacterium (P. boryanum) via an amorphous gold(I) sulphide intermediate. ‚ÄòBacterioform‚Äô gold and secondary gold crystals are common in quartz pebble conglomerates (QPC), where they are often associated with bituminous organic matter possibly derived from cyanobacteria. This may suggest that cyanobacteria have played a role in the formation of the Witwatersrand QPC, the world's largest gold deposit.",TRUE
The Great Silk Alternative: Multiple Co-Evolution of Web Loss and Sticky Hairs in Spiders,"Spiders are the most important terrestrial predators among arthropods. Their ecological success is reflected by a high biodiversity and the conquest of nearly every terrestrial habitat. Spiders are closely associated with silk, a material, often seen to be responsible for their great ecological success and gaining high attention in life sciences. However, it is often overlooked that more than half of all Recent spider species have abandoned web building or never developed such an adaptation. These species must have found other, more economic solutions for prey capture and retention, compensating the higher energy costs of increased locomotion activity. Here we show that hairy adhesive pads (scopulae) are closely associated with the convergent evolution of a vagrant life style, resulting in highly diversified lineages of at least, equal importance as the derived web building taxa. Previous studies often highlighted the idea that scopulae have the primary function of assisting locomotion, neglecting the fact that only the distal most pads (claw tufts) are suitable for those purposes. The former observations, that scopulae are used in prey capture, are largely overlooked. Our results suggest the scopulae evolved as a substitute for silk in controlling prey and that the claw tufts are, in most cases, a secondary development. Evolutionary trends towards specialized claw tufts and their composition from a low number of enlarged setae to a dense array of slender ones, as well as the secondary loss of those pads are discussed further. Hypotheses about the origin of the adhesive setae and their diversification throughout evolution are provided.",TRUE
"The hummingbird tongue is a fluid trap, not a capillary tube","Hummingbird tongues pick up a liquid, calorie-dense food that cannot be grasped, a physical challenge that has long inspired the study of nectar-transport mechanics. Existing biophysical models predict optimal hummingbird foraging on the basis of equations that assume that fluid rises through the tongue in the same way as through capillary tubes. We demonstrate that the hummingbird tongue does not function like a pair of tiny, static tubes drawing up floral nectar via capillary action. Instead, we show that the tongue tip is a dynamic liquid-trapping device that changes configuration and shape dramatically as it moves in and out of fluids. We also show that the tongue‚Äìfluid interactions are identical in both living and dead birds, demonstrating that this mechanism is a function of the tongue structure itself, and therefore highly efficient because no energy expenditure by the bird is required to drive the opening and closing of the trap. Our results rule out previous conclusions from capillarity-based models of nectar feeding and highlight the necessity of developing a new biophysical model for nectar intake in hummingbirds. Our findings have ramifications for the study of feeding mechanics in other nectarivorous birds, and for the understanding of the evolution of nectarivory in general. We propose a conceptual mechanical explanation for this unique fluid-trapping capacity, with far-reaching practical applications (e.g., biomimetics).",TRUE
The Hydraulic Mechanism of the Predatory Strike in Dragonfly Larvae,"1.Aeschna larvae catch prey with a fast-moving elongated labium. The mechanism of this movement was analysed by high-speed cinematographs and by hydrostatic and electrophysiological measurements.2.The strike movement consists of an initial, mid and late phase. The angular acceleration of the joints of the labium is 2¬∑6 √ó 105 and 7¬∑8 √ó 105 deg¬∑s‚àí2 during the initial and mid phase respectively. The torque necessary for the acceleration was calculated to be 1¬∑3 √ó 10‚àí5 and 4¬∑0 √ó 10‚àí5 N.m for the initial and mid-phases respectively.3.The relation between the pressure applied to the labium and the extension torque at the joints has been established. No torque develops about the postmentum-prementum joint as long as the click of the flexed labium is engaged.4.The power production of the extensor muscles is less than the power output of the mid phase. The power for the mid phase is derived from the internal body pressure developed by the contraction of the abdominal dorsoventral muscles. The required pressure for the mid phase is about 60 cmH2O if the resistance is neglected and 80 cmH2O when the resistance is considered.5.Abdominal dorso-ventral muscles contract 110‚Äì500 ms before the onset of the strike and the body pressure of the animal increases to a peak of 40‚Äì120 cmH2O at the onset of the strike.6.The geometry of the labial joints gives the primary flexor muscles of the labium a large mechanical advantage over the extensor muscles in the fully flexed labium, and allows the extensor muscles to contract almost isometrically.7.The extensor muscles and the primary flexor muscles co-contract for 75‚Äì100 ms before the strike. The strike movement begins when the flexor muscles relax. The stored energy in the extensor system is released suddenly and disengages the click producing the initial phase. Once the click is disengaged the internal pressure produces the large torque to move the labium with great acceleration during the mid phase.",TRUE
The hydrodynamic function of shark skin and two biomimetic applications,"SUMMARY It has long been suspected that the denticles on shark skin reduce hydrodynamic drag during locomotion, and a number of man-made materials have been produced that purport to use shark-skin-like surface roughness to reduce drag during swimming. But no studies to date have tested these claims of drag reduction under dynamic and controlled conditions in which the swimming speed and hydrodynamics of shark skin and skin-like materials can be quantitatively compared with those of controls lacking surface ornamentation or with surfaces in different orientations. We use a flapping foil robotic device that allows accurate determination of the self-propelled swimming (SPS) speed of both rigid and flexible membrane-like foils made of shark skin and two biomimetic models of shark skin to measure locomotor performance. We studied the SPS speed of real shark skin, a silicone riblet material with evenly spaced ridges and a Speedo¬Æ ‚Äòshark skin-like‚Äô swimsuit fabric attached to rigid flat-plate foils and when made into flexible membrane-like foils. We found no consistent increase in swimming speed with Speedo¬Æ fabric, a 7.2% increase with riblet material, whereas shark skin membranes (but not rigid shark skin plates) showed a mean 12.3% increase in swimming speed compared with the same skin foils after removing the denticles. Deformation of the shark skin membrane is thus crucial to the drag-reducing effect of surface denticles. Digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) of the flow field surrounding moving shark skin foils shows that skin denticles promote enhanced leading-edge suction, which might have contributed to the observed increase in swimming speed. Shark skin denticles might thus enhance thrust, as well as reduce drag.",TRUE
"The ice worm, Mesenchytraeus solifugus, elevates adenylate levels at low physiological temperature.","The ice worm, Mesenchytraeus solifugus, is among a few metazoan species that survive exclusively in glacier ice/snow. In this study, we demonstrate that ice worm adenylate levels [i.e. adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), ADP and AMP] are maintained at levels well above their mesophilic counterparts, and that their response to temperature change is distinctly opposite, namely, ice worms increase energy levels as temperatures fall. Initially, this response is characterized by a sharp spike in [ATP] and the adenylate energy charge (even at sub-zero temperatures), which is followed by corresponding increases in [ADP] and [AMP] within a few days. These results suggest that ice worms have evolved a compensatory mechanism by which gains in adenylate nucleotides off-set, at least in part, the inherent lethargy and death usually associated with cold temperature.",TRUE
The image-forming mirror in the eye of the scallop,"Fine-tuned for image formation We typically think of eyes as having one or more lenses for focusing incoming light onto a surface such as our retina. However, light can also be focused using arrays of mirrors, as is commonly done in telescopes. A biological example of this is the scallop, which can have up to 200 reflecting eyes that focus light onto two retinas. Palmer et al. find that spatial vision in the scallop is achieved through precise control of the size, shape, and packing density of the tiles of guanine that together make up an image-forming mirror at the back of each of the eyes. Science, this issue p. 1172 The crystal morphology, organization, and three-dimensional shape of the scallop eye mirror are finely controlled for image formation. Scallops possess a visual system comprising up to 200 eyes, each containing a concave mirror rather than a lens to focus light. The hierarchical organization of the multilayered mirror is controlled for image formation, from the component guanine crystals at the nanoscale to the complex three-dimensional morphology at the millimeter level. The layered structure of the mirror is tuned to reflect the wavelengths of light penetrating the scallop‚Äôs habitat and is tiled with a mosaic of square guanine crystals, which reduces optical aberrations. The mirror forms images on a double-layered retina used for separately imaging the peripheral and central fields of view. The tiled, off-axis mirror of the scallop eye bears a striking resemblance to the segmented mirrors of reflecting telescopes.",TRUE
The immunogenetics of sexual parasitism,"Reconfiguring an immune response The deep sea is a vast and generally empty environment. Finding a mate can thus be difficult. In response to this situation, one group of deep-sea denizens, the anglerfishes, have evolved a system in which males attach to females, in some cases permanently, through fusion of tissues and connection of circulatory systems. Such attachment greatly challenges the immune systems of the fish. Swann et al. found that these challenges have been met by the evolution of increasingly reduced immune responses among anglerfish species, including the loss of what have been considered essential vertebrate responses. These shifts suggest that vertebrate immune systems may be more flexible over evolutionary time than was previously thought. Science, this issue p. 1608 Anglerfish display altered immune responses to accommodate an unusual male attachment reproductive strategy. Sexual parasitism has evolved as a distinctive mode of reproduction among deep-sea anglerfishes. The permanent attachment of males to host females observed in these species represents a form of anatomical joining, which is otherwise unknown in nature. Pronounced modifications to immune facilities are associated with this reproductive trait. The genomes of species with temporarily attaching males lack functional aicda genes that underpin affinity maturation of antibodies. Permanent attachment is associated with additional alterations, culminating in the loss of functional rag genes in some species, abolishing somatic diversification of antigen receptor genes, the hallmark of canonical adaptive immunity. In anglerfishes, coevolution of innate and adaptive immunity has been disentangled, implying that an alternative form of immunity supported the emergence of this evolutionarily successful group of vertebrates.",TRUE
The Implications of Niche Construction and Ecosystem Engineering for Conservation Biology,"Although strategies to conserve biodiversity (e.g., the establishment of reserves and the management of flagship, umbrella, indicator, and keystone species) are valuable, they entail practical and conceptual difficulties. A focus on niche construction and ecosystem engineering, however, could provide new insights and methods for conservation biology. Many organisms modulate the availability of resources to other species by causing state changes in biotic or abiotic materials (ecosystem engineering), in the process frequently changing the selection to which the ecosystem engineers and other organisms are exposed (niche construction). We describe growing evidence that organisms have significant nontrophic impacts on ecosystem structure, function, and biodiversity, and outline established means of identifying key species involved in niche construction. On the basis of this engineering perspective, we propose a number of measures that could be employed to enhance conservation efforts.",TRUE
The incidence and implications of clouds for cloud forest plant water relations.,"Although clouds are the most recognisable and defining feature of tropical montane cloud forests, little research has focussed on how clouds affect plant functioning. We used satellite and ground-based observations to study cloud and leaf wetting patterns in contrasting tropical montane and pre-montane cloud forests. We then studied the consequences of leaf wetting for the direct uptake of water accumulated on leaf surfaces into the leaves themselves. During the dry season, the montane forest experienced higher precipitation, cloud cover and leaf wetting events of longer duration than the pre-montane forest. Leaf wetting events resulted in foliar water uptake in all species studied. The capacity for foliar water uptake differed significantly between the montane and pre-montane forest plant communities, as well as among species within a forest.

The influence of fallback foods on great ape tooth enamel.,"Lucas and colleagues recently proposed a model based on fracture and deformation concepts to describe how mammalian tooth enamel may be adapted to the mechanical demands of diet (Lucas et al.: Bioessays 30 2008 374-385). Here we review the applicability of that model by examining existing data on the food mechanical properties and enamel morphology of great apes (Pan, Pongo, and Gorilla). Particular attention is paid to whether the consumption of fallback foods is likely to play a key role in influencing great ape enamel morphology. Our results suggest that this is indeed the case. We also consider the implications of this conclusion on the evolution of the dentition of extinct hominins.",TRUE
The influence of stochastic behavior on the human threshold of hearing,"Abstract The inner hair cells in the cochlea perform the crucial task of transforming mechanical sound signals into electrical activity. The cochlear nerve fibers code this information and convey it to the brain for further processing. This study investigates the performance of the system inner hair cell ‚Äì primary auditory afferent nerve fibers at the physical limit of the mechano-electrical transduction for the human auditory frequency range. The Brownian motion of the hair cell‚Äôs receptive organelle, the hair bundle, does not blunt the sensitivity, but in fact enlarges ‚Äì especially in frequency regions which are most important for the perception of music and speech ‚Äì via the mechanism of nonlinear stochastic resonance (SR) the dynamical range of the mechano-electrical transduction by at least one order of magnitude. The coding efficiency of small sinusoidal hair bundle deflections shows basic properties of the human hearing threshold curve for pure tones and corresponds to experimental results of noise-induced tuning curves in mechano-receptors in the rat foot. Furthermore, the model explains how altered coding efficiency contributes to pathological changes in the spiking pattern which arise from morphological changes in the hair bundle structure (e.g., in noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss of cochlear origin).",TRUE
The influence of surface energy on the self-cleaning of insect adhesive devices,"SUMMARY The ability of insects to adhere to surfaces is facilitated by the use of adhesive organs found on the terminal leg segments. These adhesive pads are inherently ‚Äòtacky‚Äô and are expected to be subject to contamination by particulates, leading to loss of function. Here, we investigated the self-cleaning of ants and beetles by comparing the abilities of both hairy and smooth pad forms to self-clean on both high and low energy surfaces after being fouled with microspheres of two sizes and surface energies. We focused on the time taken to regain adhesive potential in unrestrained Hymenopterans (Polyrhachis dives and Myrmica scabrinodis) and Coccinellids (Harmonia axyridis and Adalia bipunctata) fouled with microspheres. We found that the reattainment of adhesion is influenced by particle type and size in Hymenopterans, with an interaction between the surface energy of the contaminating particle and substrate. In Coccinellids, reattainment of adhesion was only influenced by particle size and substrate properties. The adhesive organs of Coccinellids appear to possess superior self-cleaning abilities compared with those of Hymenopterans, although Hymenopterans exhibit better adhesion to both surface types.",TRUE

The insect exoskeleton: A natural structural composite,"Through untold centuries of evolutionary development, the insect exoskeleton has become a highly optimized structure suited to a variety of demanding duties. Microscopic examination of the bessbeetle cuticle indicates that it is a composite consisting of layered plies having fiber orientations that alternate in a dual helicoidal pattern. Further, the geometry and size of the reinforcing fibers varies with the position of the ply. Several interesting structures discovered in the insect exoskeleton may provide fodder for new ideas on composite joining, ply orientation and fiber size and geometry.",TRUE
The KaÃÅrmaÃÅn gait: novel body kinematics of rainbow trout swimming in a vortex street,"SUMMARY Most fishes commonly experience unsteady flows and hydrodynamic perturbations during their lifetime. In this study, we provide evidence that rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss voluntarily alter their body kinematics when interacting with vortices present in the environment that are not self-generated. To demonstrate this, we measured axial swimming kinematics in response to changes in known hydrodynamic wake characteristics. We compared trout swimming in the KaÃÅrmaÃÅn street behind different diameter cylinders (2.5 and 5 cm) at two flow speeds (2.5 and 4.5 L s-1, where L is total body length) to trout swimming in the free stream and in the cylinder bow wake. Trout swimming behind cylinders adopt a distinctive, previously undescribed pattern of movement in order to hold station, which we term the KaÃÅrmaÃÅn gait. During this gait, body amplitudes and curvatures are much larger than those of trout swimming at an equivalent flow velocity in the absence of a cylinder. Tail-beat frequency is not only lower than might be expected for a trout swimming in the reduced flow behind a cylinder, but also matches the vortex shedding frequency of the cylinder. Therefore, in addition to choosing to be in the slower flow velocity offered behind a cylinder (drafting), trout are also altering their body kinematics to synchronize with the shed vortices (tuning), using a mechanism that may not involve propulsive locomotion. This behavior is most distinctive when cylinder diameter is large relative to fish length. While tuning, trout have a longer body wavelength than the prescribed wake wavelength, indicating that only certain regions of the body may need to be oriented in a consistent manner to the oncoming vortices. Our results suggest that fish can capture energy from vortices generated by the environment to maintain station in downstream flow. Interestingly, trout swimming in front of a cylinder display lower tail-beat amplitudes and body wave speeds than trout subjected to any of the other treatments, implying that the bow wake may be the most energetically favorable region for a fish to hold station near a cylinder.",TRUE
The lantern shark's light switch: turning shallow water crypsis into midwater camouflage,"Bioluminescence is a common feature in the permanent darkness of the deep-sea. In fishes, light is emitted by organs containing either photogenic cells (intrinsic photophores), which are under direct nervous control, or symbiotic luminous bacteria (symbiotic photophores), whose light is controlled by secondary means such as mechanical occlusion or physiological suppression. The intrinsic photophores of the lantern shark Etmopterus spinax were recently shown as an exception to this rule since they appear to be under hormonal control. Here, we show that hormones operate what amounts to a unique light switch, by acting on a chromatophore iris, which regulates light emission by pigment translocation. This result strongly suggests that this shark's luminescence control originates from the mechanism for physiological colour change found in shallow water sharks that also involves hormonally controlled chromatophores: the lantern shark would have turned the initial shallow water crypsis mechanism into a midwater luminous camouflage, more efficient in the deep-sea environment.",TRUE
"The locust DCMD, a movement-detecting neurone tightly tuned to collision trajectories","A Silicon Graphics computer was used to challenge the locust descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD) neurone with images of approaching objects. The DCMD gave its strongest response, measured as either total spike number or spike frequency, to objects approaching on a direct collision course. Deviation in either a horizontal or vertical direction from a direct collision course resulted in a reduced response. The decline in the DCMD response with increasing deviation from a collision course was used as a measure of the tightness of DCMD tuning for collision trajectories. Tuning was defined as the half-width of the response when it had fallen to half its maximum level. The response tuning, measured as averaged mean spike number versus deviation away from a collision course, had a half-width at half-maximum response of 2.4 &deg;&shy;3.0 &deg; for a deviation in the horizontal direction and 3.0 &deg; for a deviation in the vertical direction. Mean peak spike frequency showed an even sharper tuning, with a half-width at half-maximum response of 1.8 &deg; for deviations away from a collision course in the horizontal plane.",TRUE
"The magnetic compass of domestic chickens, Gallus gallus","SUMMARY By directional training, young domestic chickens have been shown to use a magnetic compass; the same method has now been used to analyse the functional characteristics and the physical principles underlying the chickens' magnetic compass. Tests in magnetic fields with different intensities revealed a functional window around the intensity of the local geomagnetic field, with this window extending further towards lower than higher intensities. Testing chickens under monochromatic 465 nm blue and 645 nm red light suggested a wavelength dependence, with orientation possible under blue but not under red light. Exposing chickens to an oscillating field of 1.566 MHz led to disorientation, identifying an underlying radical pair mechanism. Local anesthesia of the upper beak, where iron-rich structures have been described as potential magnetoreceptors, did not affect the performance, suggesting that these receptors are not involved in compass orientation. These findings show obvious parallels to the magnetic compass described for European robins, indicating that chickens and small passerines use the same type of magnetic compass mechanism. This suggests that the avian magnetic compass may have evolved in the common ancestor of all present-day birds to facilitate orientation within the home range.",TRUE
"The mechanics of explosive dispersal and self-burial in the seeds of the filaree, Erodium cicutarium (Geraniaceae)","SUMMARY The filaree (Erodium cicutarium), a small, flowering plant related to geraniums, possesses a unique seed dispersal mechanism: the plant can fling its seeds up to half a meter away; and the seeds can bury themselves by drilling into the ground, twisting and untwisting in response to changes in humidity. These feats are accomplished using awns, helical bristles of dead but hygroscopically active tissue attached to the seeds. Here, we describe the kinematics of explosive dispersal and self-burial based on detailed high-speed and time-lapse videos. We use these observations to develop a simple mechanical model that accounts for the coiling behavior of the awn and allows comparison of the strain energy stored in the awn with the kinetic energy at launch. The model is used to examine tradeoffs between dispersal distance and reliability of the dispersal mechanism. The mechanical model may help in understanding the invasive potential of this species and provides a framework for examining other evolutionary tradeoffs in seed dispersal mechanisms among the Geraniaceae.",TRUE
The mechanics of slithering locomotion,"In this experimental and theoretical study, we investigate the slithering of snakes on flat surfaces. Previous studies of slithering have rested on the assumption that snakes slither by pushing laterally against rocks and branches. In this study, we develop a theoretical model for slithering locomotion by observing snake motion kinematics and experimentally measuring the friction coefficients of snakeskin. Our predictions of body speed show good agreement with observations, demonstrating that snake propulsion on flat ground, and possibly in general, relies critically on the frictional anisotropy of their scales. We have also highlighted the importance of weight distribution in lateral undulation, previously difficult to visualize and hence assumed uniform. The ability to redistribute weight, clearly of importance when appendages are airborne in limbed locomotion, has a much broader generality, as shown by its role in improving limbless locomotion.",TRUE
The mechanics of the adhesive locomotion of terrestrial gastropods,"SUMMARY Research on the adhesive locomotion of terrestrial gastropods is gaining renewed interest as it provides a source of guidance for the design of soft biomimetic robots that can perform functions currently not achievable by conventional rigid vehicles. The locomotion of terrestrial gastropods is driven by a train of periodic muscle contractions (pedal waves) and relaxations (interwaves) that propagate from their tails to their heads. These ventral waves interact with a thin layer of mucus secreted by the animal that transmits propulsive forces to the ground. The exact mechanism by which these propulsive forces are generated is still a matter of controversy. Specifically, the exact role played by the complex rheological and adhesive properties of the mucus is not clear. To provide quantitative data that could shed light on this question, we use a newly developed technique to measure, with high temporal and spatial resolution, the propulsive forces that terrestrial gastropods generate while crawling on smooth flat surfaces. The traction force measurements demonstrate the importance of the finite yield stress of the mucus in generating thrust and are consistent with the surface of the ventral foot being lifted with the passage of each pedal wave. We also show that a forward propulsive force is generated beneath each stationary interwave and that this net forward component is balanced by the resistance caused by the outer rim of the ventral foot, which slides at the speed of the center of mass of the animal. Simultaneously, the animal pulls the rim laterally inward. Analysis of the traction forces reveals that the kinematics of the pedal waves is far more complex than previously thought, showing significant spatial variation (acceleration/deceleration) as the waves move from the tail to the head of the animal.",TRUE
The Mechanics of the Flower Stem of the Sedge Carex acutiformis,"The mechanics of the triangular stems of Carex acutiformis was investigated by subjecting sections to bending and torsional tests. The stem was rigid in bending, being stiffened peripherally by lignified material around the vascular bundles, but because of its triangular shape it was vulnerable to local buckling. Despite being and narrow the stem was able to support the seed head, though it sagged appreciably towards the tip. In contrast the stem had very low torsional rigidity, both because of its triangular shape because the strands of lignified material were isolated from each other. In its lowland habitat this allows the drooping stem to twist away from the light winds, so reducing drag and the chances of self-fertilization. This method of reconfiguring is not possible in the shorter, stiffer mountain sedges which must withstand higher winds; many therefore have more circular stems which will be more efficient at resisting bending.",TRUE

The Mechanism by Which Aphids Adhere to Smooth Surfaces,"1.The adhesive force acting between the adhesive organs and substratum for a number of aphid species has been studied. In the case of Aphis fabae, the force per foot is about 10 ŒºN. This is much the same on both glass (amphiphilic) and silanized glass (hydrophobic) surfaces. The adhesive force is about 20 times greater than the gravitational force tending to detach each foot of an inverted aphid.2.The mechanism of adhesion was considered. Direct van der Waals forces and viscous force were shown to be trivial and electrostatic force and muscular force were shown to be improbable. An adhesive force resulting from surface tension at an air-fluid interface was shown to be adequate and likely.3.Evidence was collected that the working fluid of the adhesive organ has the properties of a dilute aqueous solution of a surfactant. There is a considerable reserve of fluid, presumably in the cuticle of the adhesive organ.",TRUE
"The mechanism of floral heliotropism in the snow buttercup, Ranunculus adoneus","ABSTRACT We designed field experiments using solar-trackingRanunculus adoneusflowers to determine where photo-reception occurred, which organs responded, and howmovement was achieved. Flower peduncles bend eastwardin the morning and gradually unbend over the course ofthe day. Peduncles were found to bend significantly morefrequently in the middle region near the floral bracts,1‚Äì3 cm below the flower, than elsewhere on the peduncle.Because the peduncle tip continued to track the sun evenafter the flower itself was removed, our experiments con-centrated on shielding (or conversely, exposing) variousportions of peduncles from (or to) sunlight. Photo-reception occurred primarily in the portion of the stemjust beneath the floral receptacle. By following the posi-tion of landmarks applied to the stem, we found that 40%more growth occurred on the shaded side of bent pedun-cles, compared to the sunlit side. In contrast, top-shieldedpeduncles did not solar track well and grew only 25%more on the shaded side than on the sunlit side. Thisgrowth differential corresponded to differences in celllength on the two sides of bent peduncles, with signifi-cantly longer epidermal cells occurring on the shaded sidethan on the sunlit side.Key-words: Ranunculus adoneus; snow buttercup; helio-tropism; phototropism; solar tracking.",TRUE
The mineralization and hardness of the radular teeth of the limpet Patella vulgata L.,"SummaryA study of the Patella vulgata radula has been made using: the scanning electron microscope in its normal and compositional contrast modes of operation, the electron microprobe analyser, ion etching with argon ions and microhardness testing.Only iron, silicon and small amounts of sulphur were detected in the radula. The teeth can be subdivided into a cusp, a junctional area where the cusp is joined to the base, and the base which is embedded in the radular membrane. From a study of longitudinal vertical and transverse sections of the mature teeth it was found that the cusp could be subdivided into a posterior iron-rich area (44‚Äì51% Fe, 1‚Äì6% Si) and an anterior silicon-rich area (22‚Äì30% Fe, 27‚Äì32% Si). The junctional zone consisted of a poorly mineralised layer at its border with the cusp and an iron-rich layer where it joined the base. The upper part of the base (5% Fe, 16% Si) could be clearly differentiated from the silicon-rich anterior and lower parts of the base (3‚Äì4% Fe, 28‚Äì35% Si). No minerals were detected in the membrane. The changes in the mineral content of the teeth cusps along the length of the radula were studied. Iron appeared in the cusps at the 25th row and the concentration increased to 28% at the 50th row. The iron was here evenly distributed throughout the cusp. Silicon appeared in the anterior part of the cusp at the 50th row and as it increased in concentration so the iron was displaced, and at the same time the concentration of iron increased in the posterior part of the cusp. Mineralization appeared to be complete by the 150th row.The teeth cusps appear to consist of 800 √Ö fibres grouped into 1Œº thick bundles and the tooth appears to be covered by a thin enamel-like layer. It is suggested that the fibres contain the silicon-rich phase and the matrix the iron-rich phase.The significance of the arrangement of the fibres and the distribution of the minerals are discussed with relation to the function of the teeth.",TRUE
The Molecular Basis of Nacre Formation,"A protein complex guides the process of nacre formation in mollusk shells. The mechanisms that determine the structural features of organisms are complex, and we are still far from predicting the structure of an organism by looking at its genetic makeup. An additional level of complexity exists for organisms that form body parts composed of mineralized structures such as sea shells, bone, and teeth. These organisms must also carefully control the interfaces between the soft body parts and the growing mineral. On page 1388 in this issue, Suzuki et al. (1) identify two novel proteins, Pif80 and Pif97, as key players in controlling the crystal structure of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the pearl-forming oyster Pinctada fucata. The work provides the most complete data set to date for the role of any known protein involved in mollusk biomineralization.

The moment before touchdown: landing manoeuvres of the honeybee Apis mellifera,"SUMMARY Although landing is a crucial part of insect flight, it has attracted relatively little study. Here, we investigate, for the first time, the final moments of a honeybee's (Apis mellifera) landing manoeuvre. Using high-speed video recordings, we analyse the behaviour of bees as they approach and land on surfaces of various orientations. The bees enter a stable hover phase, immediately prior to touchdown. We have quantified behaviour during this hover phase and examined whether it changes as the tilt of the landing surface is varied from horizontal (floor), through sloped (uphill) and vertical (wall), to inverted (ceiling). The bees hover at a remarkably constant distance from the surface, irrespective of its tilt. Body inclination increases progressively as the tilt of the surface is increased, and is accompanied by an elevation of the antennae. The tight correlation between the tilt of the surface, and the orientation of the body and the antennae, indicates that the bee's visual system is capable of inferring the tilt of the surface, and pointing the antennae toward it. Touchdown is initiated by extending the appendage closest to the surface, namely, the hind legs when landing on horizontal or sloping surfaces, and the front legs or antennae when landing on vertical surfaces. Touchdown on inverted surfaces is most likely triggered by a mechanosensory signal from the antennae. Evidently, bees use a landing strategy that is flexibly tailored to the varying topography of the terrain.",TRUE

THE MUSCULAR HYDROSTAT OF THE FLORIDA MANATEE (TRICHECHUS MANATUS LATIROSTRIS): A FUNCTIONAL MORPHOLOGICAL MODEL OF PERIORAL BRISTLE USE,"Facial musculature was examined in the Florida manatee, Tricbecbus manatus latirostris, in order to develop a functional model of perioral bristle use. Muscles identified include the M. levator nasolabialis, M. buccinatorius, M. maxillonasolabialis, M. centralis nasi, M. lateralis nasi, M. spbincter colli profundus pars oris, M. orbicularis oris, M. mandibularis, and M. mentalis. A new muscle, M. centralis nasi, has been named and is an integral part of perioral bristle movement. The snout of the Florida manatee is capable of performing complex movements. The prehensile ability of Florida manatees can be explained in the context of a muscular hydrostat as defined by Kier and Smith (1985). Eversion of certain bristles in the upper lip occurs by shortening longitudinal, transverse, and semicircular muscles in combination with volume displacement due to compensatory changes in the shape of the snout. Midline sweeping of these bristles is accomplished by the contraction of M. centralis nasi. Eversion of bristles on the lower jaw is a result of shortening of M. mentalis. Contraction of M. orbicularis oris pushes vegetation into the oral cavity. All observed movement patterns and uses of perioral bristles can be explained by variation of these sequences within the context of muscular hydrostat function.",TRUE
The narrow-leaf syndrome: a functional and evolutionary approach to the form of fog-harvesting rosette plants,"Plants that use fog as an important water-source frequently have a rosette growth habit. The performance of this morphology in relation to fog interception has not been studied. Some first-principles from physics predict that narrow leaves, together with other ancillary traits (large number and high flexibility of leaves, caudices, and/or epiphytism) which constitute the ‚Äúnarrow-leaf syndrome‚Äù should increase fog-interception efficiency. This was tested using aluminum models of rosettes that differed in leaf length, width and number and were exposed to artificial fog. The results were validated using seven species of Tillandsia and four species of xerophytic rosettes. The total amount of fog intercepted in rosette plants increased with total leaf area, while narrow leaves maximized interception efficiency (measured as interception per unit area). The number of leaves in the rosettes is physically constrained because wide-leafed plants can only have a few blades. At the limits of this constraint, net fog interception was independent of leaf form, but interception efficiency was maximized by large numbers of narrow leaves. Atmospheric Tillandsia species show the narrow-leaf syndrome. Their fog interception efficiencies were correlated to the ones predicted from aluminum-model data. In the larger xerophytic rosette species, the interception efficiency was greatest in plants showing the narrow-leaf syndrome. The adaptation to fog-harvesting in several narrow-leaved rosettes was tested for evolutionary convergence in 30 xerophytic rosette species using a comparative method. There was a significant evolutionary tendency towards the development of the narrow-leaf syndrome the closer the species grew to areas where fog is frequently available. This study establishes convergence in a very wide group of plants encompassing genera as contrasting as Tillandsia and Agave as a result of their dependence on fog.",TRUE
The ontogenetic changes in the thermal properties of blubber from Atlantic bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus,"SUMMARY In Atlantic bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus, both the thickness and lipid content of blubber vary across ontogeny and across individuals of differing reproductive and nutritional status. This study investigates how these changes in blubber morphology and composition influence its thermal properties. Thermal conductivity (W m‚Äì1 deg.‚Äì1, where deg. is ¬∞C) and thermal insulation (m2 deg. W‚Äì1) of dolphin blubber were measured in individuals across an ontogenetic series (fetus through adult, N=36), pregnant females (N=4) and emaciated animals (N=5). These thermal properties were determined by the simultaneous use of two common experimental approaches, the heat flux disc method and the standard material method. Thickness, lipid and water content were measured for each blubber sample. Thermal conductivity and insulation varied significantly across ontogeny. Blubber from fetuses through sub-adults was less conductive (range=0.11‚Äì0.13¬±0.02 W m‚Äì1 deg.‚Äì1) than that of adults (mean=0.18 W m‚Äì1 deg.‚Äì1). The conductivity of blubber from pregnant females was similar to non-adult categories, while that of emaciated animals was significantly higher (0.24 ¬± 0.04 W m deg.‚Äì1) than all other categories. Blubber from sub-adults and pregnant females had the highest insulation values while fetuses and emaciated animals had the lowest. In nutritionally dependant life history categories, changes in blubber's thermal insulation were characterized by stable blubber quality (i.e. conductivity) and increased blubber quantity (i.e. thickness). In nutritionally independent animals, blubber quantity remained stable while blubber quality varied. A final, unexpected observation was that heat flux measurements at the deep blubber surface were significantly higher than that at the superficial surface, a pattern not observed in control materials. This apparent ability to absorb heat, coupled with blubber's fatty acid composition, suggest that dolphin integument may function as a phase change material.",TRUE
The physical state of water in bacterial spores,"The bacterial spore, the hardiest known life form, can survive in a metabolically dormant state for many years and can withstand high temperatures, radiation, and toxic chemicals. The molecular basis of spore dormancy and resistance is not understood, but the physical state of water in the different spore compartments is thought to play a key role. To characterize this water in situ, we recorded the water 2H and 17O spin relaxation rates in D2O-exchanged Bacillus subtilis spores over a wide frequency range. The data indicate high water mobility throughout the spore, comparable with binary protein‚Äìwater systems at similar hydration levels. Even in the dense core, the average water rotational correlation time is only 50 ps. Spore dormancy therefore cannot be explained by glass-like quenching of molecular diffusion but may be linked to dehydration-induced conformational changes in key enzymes. The data demonstrate that most spore proteins are rotationally immobilized, which may contribute to heat resistance by preventing heat-denatured proteins from aggregating irreversibly. We also find that the water permeability of the inner membrane is at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than for model membranes, consistent with the reported high degree of lipid immobilization in this membrane and with its proposed role in spore resistance to chemicals that damage DNA. The quantitative results reported here on water mobility and transport provide important clues about the mechanism of spore dormancy and resistance, with relevance to food preservation, disease prevention, and astrobiology.",TRUE

"The physiology of vocalization by the echolocating oilbird,Steatornis caripensis","Summary1.Oilbirds (Steatornis caripensis; Steatornithidae) have a bilaterally asymmetrical bronchial syrinx (Fig. 2) with which they produce echolocating clicks and a variety of social vocalizations. The sonar clicks typically have a duration of about 40 to 50 ms and can be classified as continuous, double or single. Agonistic squawks typically have a duration of about 0.5 s and contain multiple harmonic components (Figs. 5, 6).2.Both sonar clicks and agonistic squawks are initiated by contraction of the sternotrachealis muscles (Figs. 7 and 16) which stretch the trachea, reducing the tension across the syrinx and causing the cartilaginous bronchial semi-rings supporting the cranial and caudal edges of the external tympaniform membranes (ETM) to hinge inward, folding the ETM into the syringeal lumen (Fig. 17). Bernoulli forces created by expiratory air flowing through the restricted syringeal aperture presumably initiate vibration of the internal and/or external tympaniform membranes.3.Social vocalizations such as the agonistic squawk, continue until the sternotrachealis muscles relax (Fig. 10), allowing the cranial portion of the bronchus to move anteriad and abducting the ETM.4.Sonar clicks are terminated by rapid contraction of a previously undescribed intrinsic syringeal muscle, the broncholateralis, which inserts on the semi-ring supporting the anterior edge of the ETM and causes it to rotate about its articulation with the next anterior bronchial cartilage in such a way that it abducts the ETM (Figs. 8, 16, 17). Musculus broncholateralis contracts only during sonar clicks, appears to have a high proportion of twitch-type fibers, and is specialized for the rapid abduction of the ETM to produce short duration, click-like vocalizations.5.Tracheal airflow and sternal air sac pressure reflect the changes in the syringeal aperture. Tracheal airflow at first increases as expiratory effort increases subsyringeal pressure. The initial high rate of airflow drops at the onset of phonation due to the increased syringeal resistance. In the case of a double click, airflow momentarily ceases during the intraclick interval when the ETM temporarily closes the syrinx. Air sac pressure rises to its maximum level at this time. Expiratory airflow rapidly increases as the ETM is abducted from either its closed or phonatory position to its open, resting position. Each sonar click requires about 1 cm3 of air; a typical agonistic squawk may use about 27 cm3 of air (Figs. 11, 12, 13; Tables 3, 4).6.Each sonar click is often accompanied by a complete respiratory cycle or ‚Äòmini-breath‚Äô (Fig. 11). Pulmonary ventilation can be controlled independently from the clicking rate by varying the tidal volume of the mini-breaths, which may be as small as the tracheal and bronchial dead space. Mini-breaths permit oilbirds to produce click trains having a long train duration uninterrupted by a long inspiration.7.A dual flow probe was used to simultaneously measure the rate of airflow through each semi-syrinx during vocalization. The rate of airflow through the right semi-syrinx was 40 to 60% greater than that through the left. Both syringes functioned together except during the middle portion of some continuous type sonar clicks when sound was sometimes generated only by one semi-syrinx, the other being closed (Figs. 14, 15; Tables 5, 6).8.The fluid subsyringeal power reaches approximately 100 and 150 mW in the left and right semi-syrinx, respectively, during the second member of a double sonar click (Table 6). Total syringeal power during agonistic squawks reaches at least 60 mW and syringeal resistance during these vocalizations is as high as 1500 cm H20/LPS (Table 7).",TRUE
The phytopathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum detoxifies plant glucosinolate hydrolysis products via an isothiocyanate hydrolase,"Brassicales plants produce glucosinolates and myrosinases that generate toxic isothiocyanates conferring broad resistance against pathogens and herbivorous insects. Nevertheless, some cosmopolitan fungal pathogens, such as the necrotrophic white mold Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, are able to infect many plant hosts including glucosinolate producers. Here, we show that S. sclerotiorum infection activates the glucosinolate-myrosinase system, and isothiocyanates contribute to resistance against this fungus. S. sclerotiorum metabolizes isothiocyanates via two independent pathways: conjugation to glutathione and, more effectively, hydrolysis to amines. The latter pathway features an isothiocyanate hydrolase that is homologous to a previously characterized bacterial enzyme, and converts isothiocyanate into products that are not toxic to the fungus. The isothiocyanate hydrolase promotes fungal growth in the presence of the toxins, and contributes to the virulence of S. sclerotiorum on glucosinolate-producing plants. Some plants produce toxic isothiocyanates that protect them against pathogens. Here, Chen et al. show that the plant pathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum converts isothiocyanates into non-toxic compounds via glutathione conjugation and, more effectively, via hydrolysis to amines using an isothiocyanate hydrolase.",TRUE
"The potential of the solitary parasitoid Microctonus brassicae for the biological control of the adult cabbage stem flea beetle, Psylliodes chrysocephala","The cabbage stem flea beetle (CSFB), Psylliodes chrysocephala L. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is a major pest of oilseed rape, Brassica napus L. (Brassicaceae), within the UK and continental Europe. Following the withdrawal of many broad‚Äêspectrum pesticides, most importantly neonicotinoids, and with increased incidence of pyrethroid resistance, few chemical control options remain, resulting in the need for alternative pest management strategies. We identified the parasitoid wasp Microctonus brassicae (Haeselbarth) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) within CSFB collected from three independent sites in Norfolk, UK. Parasitism of adult CSFB was confirmed, and wasp oviposition behaviour was described. Moreover, we show that within captive colonies parasitism rates are sufficient to generate significant biological control of CSFB populations. A sequence of the M. brassicae mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (MT‚ÄêCO1) gene was generated for rapid future identification.

The protective role of aquaporins in the freeze-tolerant insect Eurosta solidaginis: functional characterization and tissue abundance of EsAQP1,"SUMMARY The movement of water and small solutes is integral to the survival of freezing and desiccation in insects, yet the underlying mechanisms of these processes are not fully known. Recent evidence suggests that aquaporin (AQP) water channels play critical roles in protecting cells from osmotic damage during freezing and desiccation. Our study sequenced, functionally characterized and measured the tissue abundance of an AQP from freeze-tolerant larvae of the gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae). The newly characterized EsAQP1 contains two NPA motifs and six transmembrane regions, and is phylogenetically related to an AQP from the anhydrobiotic chironomid Polypedilum vanderplanki. Using a Xenopus laevis oocyte swelling assay, we demonstrated that EsAQP1 increases water permeability to nine times that of simple diffusion through the membrane. In contrast to its high water permeability, EsAQP1 was impermeable to both glycerol and urea. The abundance of EsAQP1 increased from October to December in all tissues tested and was most abundant in the brain of winter larvae. Because the nervous system is thought to be the primary site of freezing injury, EsAQP1 may cryoprotect the brain from damage associated with water imbalance. The sequence, phylogenetic relationship, osmotic permeability, tissue distribution and seasonal abundance of EsAQP1 further support the role of AQPs in promoting freezing tolerance.",TRUE
The Protective Role of Bark and Bark Fibers of the Giant Sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) during High-Energy Impacts,"The influences of (1) a high fiber content, (2) the arrangement of fibers in fiber groups, and (3) a layered hierarchical composition of the bark of the giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) on its energy dissipation capability are analyzed and discussed regarding the relevance for an application in bioinspired components in civil engineering. The giant sequoia is native to the Sierra Nevada (USA), a region with regular rockfalls. It is thus regularly exposed to high-energy impacts, with its bark playing a major protective role, as can be seen in the wild and has been proven in laboratory experiments. The authors quantify the fundamental biomechanical properties of the bark at various length scales, taking into account its hierarchical setup ranging from the integral level (whole bark) down to single bark fibers. Microtensile tests on single fibers and fiber pairs give insights into the properties of single fibers as well as the benefits of the strong longitudinal interconnection between single fibers arranged in pairs. Going beyond the level of single fibers or fiber pairs, towards the integral level, quasistatic compression tests and dynamic impact tests are performed on samples comprising the whole bark (inner and outer bark). These tests elucidate the deformation behavior under quasistatic compression and dynamic impact relevant for the high energy dissipation and impact-damping behavior of the bark. The remarkable energy dissipation capability of the bark at the abovementioned hierarchical levels are linked to the layered and fibrous structure of the bark structurally analyzed by thin sections and SEM and ¬µCT scans.",TRUE
The Regulation of Ant Colony Foraging Activity without Spatial Information,"Many dynamical networks, such as the ones that produce the collective behavior of social insects, operate without any central control, instead arising from local interactions among individuals. A well-studied example is the formation of recruitment trails in ant colonies, but many ant species do not use pheromone trails. We present a model of the regulation of foraging by harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex barbatus) colonies. This species forages for scattered seeds that one ant can retrieve on its own, so there is no need for spatial information such as pheromone trails that lead ants to specific locations. Previous work shows that colony foraging activity, the rate at which ants go out to search individually for seeds, is regulated in response to current food availability throughout the colony's foraging area. Ants use the rate of brief antennal contacts inside the nest between foragers returning with food and outgoing foragers available to leave the nest on the next foraging trip. Here we present a feedback-based algorithm that captures the main features of data from field experiments in which the rate of returning foragers was manipulated. The algorithm draws on our finding that the distribution of intervals between successive ants returning to the nest is a Poisson process. We fitted the parameter that estimates the effect of each returning forager on the rate at which outgoing foragers leave the nest. We found that correlations between observed rates of returning foragers and simulated rates of outgoing foragers, using our model, were similar to those in the data. Our simple stochastic model shows how the regulation of ant colony foraging can operate without spatial information, describing a process at the level of individual ants that predicts the overall foraging activity of the colony.",TRUE
The responses of the pupil of Gekko gekko to external light stimulus,1. The responses of the pupil of a nocturnal gecko (Gekko gekko) to external light stimulus were studied. 2. The responses of the pupil are determined by light entering the pupil and not by light acting directly on the iris. 3. The responses of the pupil are very uniform in sensitivity including spectral sensitivity for light coming in different directions to the eye. 4. The possible change in area of the pupil is more than 300-fold and probably represents an effort to shield the pure rod retina from saturating light intensities. 5. The pupil continues to contract sharply for changes in external light intensity which give retinal illuminations corresponding to 10(6) quanta/sec. striking a retinal rod. 6. There is a large degree of spatial summation of the response; circular external light fields subtending 5 and 140 degrees giving the same illumination at the pupil give approximately the same pupil response. 7. The spectral sensitivity curve agrees with the absorption curve of an extracted pigment from a closely related gecko described by Crescitelli in the followig paper. It is similar to the human scotopic curve but its maximum is displaced about 20 to 30 mmicro towards the red end of the spectrum. The fall in sensitivity towards the red end of the spectrum is described by the equation See PDF for Equation,TRUE
"The role of biota in the initiation and growth of islands on the floodplain of the Okavango alluvial fan, Botswana","A group of islands of varying size on the floodplain of the Okavango alluvial fan, were studied to establish the processes which lead to the initiation and growth of islands. It was found that islands are initiated by the mound-building activities of the termite Macrotermes michaelseni. These termites import fine grained materials to use as a mortar for the construction of epigeal mounds. Their activities create a topographic feature, raised above the level of seasonal flooding, and also change the physical properties and nutrient status of the mound soil. Shrubs and trees are able to colonize these mounds, which results in increased transpiration. As a result, precipitation of calcite and silica from the shallow ground water occurs preferentially beneath the mounds, resulting in vertical and especially lateral growth, causing island expansion. ¬© 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",TRUE
The role of dung beetles in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cattle farming,"Agriculture is one of the largest anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs), with dairy and beef production accounting for nearly two-thirds of emissions. Several recent papers suggest that dung beetles may affect fluxes of GHGs from cattle farming. Here, we put these previous findings into context. Using Finland as an example, we assessed GHG emissions at three scales: the dung pat, pasture ecosystem, and whole lifecycle of milk or beef production. At the first two levels, dung beetles reduced GHG emissions by up to 7% and 12% respectively, mainly through large reductions in methane (CH4) emissions. However, at the lifecycle level, dung beetles accounted for only a 0.05‚Äì0.13% reduction of overall GHG emissions. This mismatch derives from the fact that in intensive production systems, only a limited fraction of all cow pats end up on pastures, offering limited scope for dung beetle mitigation of GHG fluxes. In contrast, we suggest that the effects of dung beetles may be accentuated in tropical countries, where more manure is left on pastures, and dung beetles remove and aerate dung faster, and that this is thus a key area for future research. These considerations give a new perspective on previous results perspective, and suggest that studies of biotic effects on GHG emissions from dung pats on a global scale are a priority for current research.",TRUE
The role of granules within viscous capture threads of orb-weaving spiders,"SUMMARY Sticky viscous prey capture threads form the spiral elements of spider orb-webs and are responsible for retaining insects that strike a web. These threads are formed of regularly spaced aqueous droplets that surround a pair of supporting axial fibers. When a thread is flattened on a microscope slide a small, opaque granule can usually be seen within each droplet. These granules have been thought to be the glycoprotein glue that imparts thread adhesion. Both independent contrast and standard regressions showed that granule size is directly related to droplet volume and indicated that granule volume is about 15% of droplet volume. We attempted to find support for the hypothesized adhesive role of granules by establishing an association between the contact surface area and volume of these granules and the stickiness of the viscous threads of 16 species in the context of a six-variable model that describes thread stickiness. However, we found that granule size made either an insignificant or a small negative contribution to thread stickiness. Consequently, we hypothesize that granules serve to anchor larger, surrounding layers of transparent glycoprotein glue to the axial fibers of the thread, thereby equipping droplets to resist slippage on the axial fibers as these droplets generate adhesion, elongate under a load, and transfer force to the axial fibers.",TRUE
The role of kinship in helping decisions among white-fronted bee-eaters,"SummaryWhite-fronted bee-eaters (Merops bullockoides) are cooperative breeders in which half of all nesting attempts are assisted by non-breeding adults in addition to the breeding pair. These ‚Äúhelpers‚Äù assist in all aspects of nesting and their aid significantly increases fledging success. The social unit in these bee-eaters is an extended family clan in which multiple pairs may breed simultaneously (plural breeding). As a result, helpers often have to choose how to allocate their aid among several potential recipients to whom they are unequally related. Using five years of data from a color-marked and genealogically known population of white-fronted bee-eaters in Kenya, we examined the role of kinship in three helping ‚Äúdecisions‚Äù: 1) whether or not to become a helper, 2) whom to help, and 3) how much help to provide.1)Kinship between potential donor and recipient was a significant predictor of the likelihood of helping. Fully 44% of the individuals that could have become helpers did not do so. Many of these non-helpers were unrelated mates (‚Äúin-laws‚Äù) that had paired into their partner's clan and had no genetic link to the available recipients. Others were natal clan members with only distant genealogical ties to the breeders. The conditional probability of helping (see text for definition) decreased significantly with decreasing rh(coefficient of relatedness) between the potential helper and nestling recipients. The presumed cost of helping was a second significant predictor of whether or not a bird became a helper. We considered the expending of effort in providing aid and the delaying of personal reproduction to be costs of helping. Potential helpers that had engaged in high effort activities in the few weeks prior to the helping opportunity showed a decreased likelihood of becoming helpers. Similarly, paired birds (which by virtue of having a mating partner had a greater potential of breeding) were less likely to become helpers than were single individuals.2)Bee-eater helpers preferentially chose to aid their closest genetic relatives. The average relatedness between helpers and the nestlings receiving their aid was 0.33. This degree of kinship was significantly greater than that expected if helpers had selected recipient nests randomly from among those available within their clans. Further evidence of kin discrimination came from analysis of 115 instances in which a helper had two or more nests of differing relatedness simultaneously available as potential recipients. In 108 cases (94%), the helper aided the most closely related one.3)The magnitude of the helping contribution (as measured by provisioning rate) showed no pattern with relatedness between donor and recipient. These data allow testing of various theoretical models for the allocation of aid among kin. Since bee-eaters helped at only one nest at a time, and selected the nest with the most closely related young available, their behavior conforms to an allor-none case of a diminishing returns model and is inconsistent with alternative models based upon the distribution of aid in proportion to relatedness. We conclude that kinship is a major determinant in the decisions both of whether to become a helper, and of whom to help, in white-fronted bee-eaters.",TRUE
The Role of Wheat Awns in the Seed Dispersal Unit,"The dispersal unit of wild wheat bears two pronounced awns that balance the unit as it falls. We discovered that the awns are also able to propel the seeds on and into the ground. The arrangement of cellulose fibrils causes bending of the awns with changes in humidity. Silicified hairs that cover the awns allow propulsion of the unit only in the direction of the seeds. This suggests that the dead tissue is analogous to a motor. Fueled by the daily humidity cycle, the awns induce the motility required for seed dispersal",TRUE

The Scaly-foot Snail genome and implications for the origins of biomineralised armour,"The Scaly-foot Snail, Chrysomallon squamiferum , presents a combination of biomineralised features, reminiscent of enigmatic early fossil taxa with complex shells and sclerites such as sachtids, but in a recently-diverged living species which even has iron-infused hard parts. Thus the Scaly-foot Snail is an ideal model to study the genomic mechanisms underlying the evolutionary diversification of biomineralised armour. Here, we present a high-quality whole-genome assembly and tissue-specific transcriptomic data, and show that scale and shell formation in the Scaly-foot Snail employ independent subsets of 25 highly-expressed transcription factors. Comparisons with other lophotrochozoan genomes imply that this biomineralisation toolkit is ancient, though expression patterns differ across major lineages. We suggest that the ability of lophotrochozoan lineages to generate a wide range of hard parts, exemplified by the remarkable morphological disparity in Mollusca, draws on a capacity for dynamic modification of the expression and positioning of toolkit elements across the genome. The Scaly-foot Snail, Chrysomallon squamiferum , is a model for understanding the evolution of biomineralised armour.

The significance of pelvic fin flexibility for tree climbing fish.,"In this article, we compare the characteristics of biomechanical attachment exhibited by two morphologically different mudskipper species, Boleophthalmus boddarti (with fused pelvic fins) and Periophthalmus variabilis (with unfused pelvic fins). P. variabilis is a tree and rock climber while B. boddarti dwells in the muddy shallows and is unable to climb. Our aim in this article is to determine whether it is predominantly chemical or morphological properties of the pelvic fins from each species that may allow P. variabilis to climb trees whilst preventing B. boddarti from doing the same. To fulfil our objective we perform friction and suction resistance tests, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of the mucosal secretions under the fins, direct geometrical measurements and finite element modelling. We find that B. boddarti has considerable resistance to pull-off forces, while P. variabilis has greater frictional resistance. Both species produce mucopolysaccaharides that we suggest aid Stefan adhesion to different substrates. P. variabilis fins are, nevertheless, considerably more flexible than those of B. boddarti and we conclude that P. variabilis is consequently able to maintain a more intimate surface area of contact with underlying material, which aids Stefan adhesion, increases frictional resistance, and helps it to climb trees.",TRUE
The thermogenic center in social wasps.,"In the social wasps Vespa orientalis and Paravespula germanica (Hymenoptera, Vespinae), a thermogenic center has been found in the dorsal part of the first thoracic segment. The temperature in this region of the prothorax is higher by 6-9 degrees C than that at the tip of the abdomen, and this in actively flying hornets outside the nest (workers, males or queens) as well as in hornets inside the nest that attend to the brood in the combs. On viewing the region from the outside, one discerns a canal or rather a fissure in the cuticle, which commences at the center of the dorsal surface of the prothorax and extends till the mesothorax. Thus the length of this canal or fissure is approximately 5-7 mm and it is seen to contain numerous thin hairs whose shape varies from that of the hairs alongside the structure. Beneath the cuticle in this region there are dorsoventral as well as longitudinal muscles in abundance, much the same as the musculature in the remaining thoracic segments (i.e. the meso- and metathorax), which activate the two pairs of wings. The canal-bearing segment is of course devoid of wings, and its dorsoventral muscles are attached to the cuticle, which in this region resembles a bowl harboring several layers of epithelium that boasts numerous butterfly-shaped tracheal branches. Additionally there are layers that display lymph-filled spaces and also perforated layers and depressions, and beneath all these is a lace-like layer that also coats the cuticle's hollows. Underneath the cuticle proper, there are numerous large mitochondria and tracheae, which occupy a considerable part of the cuticular epithelium surface. These abundant mitochondria are, most probably, the main element of heat production in the thermogenic center.",TRUE
The Transition from Stiff to Compliant Materials in Squid Beaks,"The beak of the Humboldt squid Dosidicus gigas represents one of the hardest and stiffest wholly organic materials known. As it is deeply embedded within the soft buccal envelope, the manner in which impact forces are transmitted between beak and envelope is a matter of considerable scientific interest. Here, we show that the hydrated beak exhibits a large stiffness gradient, spanning two orders of magnitude from the tip to the base. This gradient is correlated with a chemical gradient involving mixtures of chitin, water, and His-rich proteins that contain 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine (dopa) and undergo extensive stabilization by histidyl-dopa cross-link formation. These findings may serve as a foundation for identifying design principles for attaching mechanically mismatched materials in engineering and biological applications.",TRUE
The tubercles on humpback whales' flippers: application of bio-inspired technology.,"The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is exceptional among the large baleen whales in its ability to undertake aquabatic maneuvers to catch prey. Humpback whales utilize extremely mobile, wing-like flippers for banking and turning. Large rounded tubercles along the leading edge of the flipper are morphological structures that are unique in nature. The tubercles on the leading edge act as passive-flow control devices that improve performance and maneuverability of the flipper. Experimental analysis of finite wing models has demonstrated that the presence of tubercles produces a delay in the angle of attack until stall, thereby increasing maximum lift and decreasing drag. Possible fluid-dynamic mechanisms for improved performance include delay of stall through generation of a vortex and modification of the boundary layer, and increase in effective span by reduction of both spanwise flow and strength of the tip vortex. The tubercles provide a bio-inspired design that has commercial viability for wing-like structures. Control of passive flow has the advantages of eliminating complex, costly, high-maintenance, and heavy control mechanisms, while improving performance for lifting bodies in air and water. The tubercles on the leading edge can be applied to the design of watercraft, aircraft, ventilation fans, and windmills.",TRUE
The Venus Flytrap Dionaea muscipula Counts Prey-Induced Action Potentials to Induce Sodium Uptake,"Summary Carnivorous plants, such as the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula), depend on an animal diet when grown in nutrient-poor soils. When an insect visits the trap and tilts the mechanosensors on the inner surface, action potentials (APs) are fired. After a moving object elicits two APs, the trap snaps shut, encaging the victim. Panicking preys repeatedly touch the trigger hairs over the subsequent hours, leading to a hermetically closed trap, which via the gland-based endocrine system is flooded by a prey-decomposing acidic enzyme cocktail. Here, we asked the question as to how many times trigger hairs have to be stimulated (e.g., now many APs are required) for the flytrap to recognize an encaged object as potential food, thus making it worthwhile activating the glands. By applying a series of trigger-hair stimulations, we found that the touch hormone jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway is activated after the second stimulus, while more than three APs are required to trigger an expression of genes encoding prey-degrading hydrolases, and that this expression is proportional to the number of mechanical stimulations. A decomposing animal contains a sodium load, and we have found that these sodium ions enter the capture organ via glands. We identified a flytrap sodium channel DmHKT1 as responsible for this sodium acquisition, with the number of transcripts expressed being dependent on the number of mechano-electric stimulations. Hence, the number of APs a victim triggers while trying to break out of the trap identifies the moving prey as a struggling Na+-rich animal and nutrition for the plant. Video Abstract",TRUE

The winter diet of the Atlantic Puffin Fratercula arctica around the Faroe Islands,"Most mortality of Atlantic Puffins occurs outside the breeding season but little is known about the species‚Äô diet at that time. The stomach contents of 176 Puffins shot legally for food around the Faroe Islands between October and January in three winters were examined. The remains of 20 species of fish, six species of crustacea and single species of polychaete, chaetognathid and squid were identified. The most frequently recorded prey in terms of frequency of occurrence were 0 group (<1 year old) Lesser Sandeel Ammodytes marinus (82% of stomachs), followed by mesopelagic fish (52%), nereid worms (41%), Silver Rockling Gaidropsarus argentatus (36%), crustacea (35%), large sandeel (32%) and other large fish (32%). In terms of calculated biomass, nereids (41%), large sandeel (23%) and other large fish (17%) made up the bulk of the diet but the latter two prey types were most important in energetic terms (46% despite accounting for only 9% of items). Stomach contents collected on the same day and location were significantly more similar than those collected on different dates and locations, suggesting that during the winter, Puffins are generalists, taking any prey they encounter.",TRUE
Thermal windows on Brazilian free-tailed bats facilitate thermoregulation during prolonged flight.,"The Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) experiences challenging thermal conditions while roosting in hot caves, flying during warm daylight conditions, and foraging at cool high altitudes. Using thermal infrared cameras, we identified hot spots along the flanks of free-ranging Brazilian free-tailed bats, ventral to the extended wings. These hot spots are absent in syntopic cave myotis (Myotis velifer), a species that forages over relatively short distances, and does not engage in long-distance migration. We hypothesized that the hot spots, or ""radiators,"" on Brazilian free-tailed bats may be adaptations for migration, particularly in this long-distance, high-flying species. We examined the vasculature of radiators on Brazilian free-tailed bats with transillumination to characterize the unique arrangements of arteries and veins that are positioned perpendicular to the body in the proximal region of the wing. We hypothesized that these radiators aid in maintaining heat balance by flushing the uninsulated thermal window with warm blood, thereby dissipating heat while bats are flying under warm conditions, but shunting blood away and conserving heat when they are flying in cooler air at high altitudes. We also examined fluid-preserved specimens representing 122 species from 15 of 18 chiropteran families and radiators appeared present only in species in the family Molossidae, including both sedentary and migratory species and subspecies. Thus, the radiator appears to be a unique trait that may facilitate energy balance and water balance during sustained dispersal, foraging, and long-distance migration.",TRUE
Thermoperception in the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus),"Summary1.The common vampire bat,Desmodus rotundus, is known to be capable of detecting temperature differences. In the experiments described here two animals were trained to give preference to the radiation emitted by a warm signal unit (the negative unit was left at room temperature). The distance between the decision line and the signal units was 8, 12 or 16 cm. Both animals responded to radiation as low as 0.5 √ó 10‚àí4 W cm‚àí2 (Fig. 3).2.Based on calculations of the radiation emitted by the human skin, vampires should be capable of detecting warm-blooded animals at a distance up to 16 cm (Fig. 4). This sense for thermal radiation may aid these bats in localizing or selecting a suitable biting site.3.Histological studies of the bats' facial structures indicate that thermal stimuli are most probably perceived in the three pits surrounding the central nose leaf: the thin, hairless and glandless skin is underlaid with dense connective tissue. Thermography reveals that the surface temperature of the nasal region is up to 9 ¬∞C lower than that of the neighboring parts of the face (Fig. 2).",TRUE
Thermoregulation during Flight: Body Temperature and Sensible Heat Transfer in Free-Ranging Brazilian Free-Tailed Bats (Tadarida brasiliensis),"Bat wings are important for thermoregulation, but their role in heat balance during flight is largely unknown. More than 80% of the energy consumed during flight generates heat as a by-product, and thus it is expected that bat wings should dissipate large amounts of heat to prevent hyperthermia. We measured rectal (Tr) and surface (Ts) temperatures of Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) as they emerged from and returned to their daytime roosts and calculated sensible heat transfer for different body regions (head, body, wings, and tail membrane). Bats‚Äô Tr decreased from 36.8¬∞C during emergence flights to 34.4¬∞C during returns, and Ts scaled positively with ambient temperature (Ta). Total radiative heat loss from bats was significantly greater for a radiative sink to the night sky than for a sink with temperature equal to Ta. We found that free-ranging Brazilian free-tailed bats, on average, do not dissipate heat from their wings by convection but instead dissipate radiative heat (L) to the cloudless night sky during flight ( W). However, within the range of Ta measured in this study, T. brasiliensis experienced net heat loss between evening emergence and return flights. Regional hypothermia reduces heat loss from wings that are exposed to potentially high convective fluxes. Additional research is needed to establish the role of wings in evaporative cooling during flight in bats.",TRUE
"Thermoregulation: What Role for UCPs in Mammals
and Birds?","Mammals and birds are endotherms and respond to cold exposure by the means of regulatory thermogenesis, either shivering or non-shivering. In this latter case, waste of cell energy as heat can be achieved by uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration. Uncoupling proteins, which belong to the mitochondrial carrier family, are able to transport protons and thus may assume a thermogenic function. The mammalian UCP1 physiological function is now well understood and gives to the brown adipose tissue the capacity for heat generation. But is it really the case for its more recently discovered isoforms UCP2 and UCP3? Additionally, whereas more and more evidence suggests that non-shivering also exists in birds, is the avian UCP also involved in response to cold exposure? In this review, we consider the latest advances in the field of UCP biology and present putative functions for UCP1 homologues.",TRUE
Thoracic scales of moths as a stealth coating against bat biosonar,"Many moths are endowed with ultrasound-sensitive ears that serve the detection and evasion of echolocating bats. Moths lacking such ears could still gain protection from bat biosonar by using stealth acoustic camouflage, absorbing sound waves rather than reflecting them back as echoes. The thorax of a moth is bulky and hence acoustically highly reflective. This renders it an obvious target for any bat. Much of the thorax of moths is covered in hair-like scales, the layout of which is remarkably similar in structure and arrangement to natural fibrous materials commonly used in sound insulation. Despite this structural similarity, the effect of thorax scales on moth echoes has never been characterized. Here, we test whether and how moth thorax scales function as an acoustic absorber. From tomographic echo images, we find that the thin layer of thoracic scales of diurnal butterflies affects the strength of ultrasound echoes from the thorax very little, while the thorax scales of earless moths absorbs an average of 67 ¬± 9% of impinging ultrasonic sound energy. We show that the thorax scales of moths provide acoustic camouflage by acting as broadband (20‚Äì160 kHz) stealth coating. Modelling results suggest the scales are acting as a porous sound absorber; however, the thorax scales of moths achieve a considerably higher absorption than technical fibrous porous absorbers with the same structural parameters. Such scales, despite being thin and lightweight, constitute a broadband, multidirectional and efficient ultrasound absorber that reduces the moths' detectability to hunting bats and gives them a survival advantage.",TRUE
Three-dimensional flow and lift characteristics of a hovering ruby-throated hummingbird,"A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation is performed for a ruby-throated hummingbird (Archilochus colubris) in hovering flight. Realistic wing kinematics are adopted in the numerical model by reconstructing the wing motion from high-speed imaging data of the bird. Lift history and the three-dimensional flow pattern around the wing in full stroke cycles are captured in the simulation. Significant asymmetry is observed for lift production within a stroke cycle. In particular, the downstroke generates about 2.5 times as much vertical force as the upstroke, a result that confirms the estimate based on the measurement of the circulation in a previous experimental study. Associated with lift production is the similar power imbalance between the two half strokes. Further analysis shows that in addition to the angle of attack, wing velocity and surface area, drag-based force and wing‚Äìwake interaction also contribute significantly to the lift asymmetry. Though the wing‚Äìwake interaction could be beneficial for lift enhancement, the isolated stroke simulation shows that this benefit is buried by other opposing effects, e.g. presence of downwash. The leading-edge vortex is stable during the downstroke but may shed during the upstroke. Finally, the full-body simulation result shows that the effects of wing‚Äìwing interaction and wing‚Äìbody interaction are small.",TRUE
Three-dimensional scaling laws of cetacean propulsion characterize the hydrodynamic interplay of flukes' shape and kinematics,"Cetaceans convert dorsoventral body oscillations into forward velocity with a complex interplay between their morphological and kinematic features and the fluid environment. However, it is unknown to what extent morpho-kinematic features of cetaceans are intertwined to maximize their efficiency. By interchanging the shape and kinematic variables of five cetacean species, the interplay of their flukes morpho-kinematic features is examined by characterizing their thrust, power and propulsive efficiency. It is determined that the shape and kinematics of the flukes have considerable influence on force production and power consumption. Three-dimensional heaving and pitching scaling laws are developed by considering both added mass and circulatory-based forces, which are shown to closely model the numerical data. Using the scaling relations as a guide, it is determined that the added mass forces are important in predicting the trend between the efficiency and aspect ratio, however, the thrust and power are driven predominately by the circulatory forces. The scaling laws also reveal that there is an optimal dimensionless heave-to-pitch ratio h* that maximizes the efficiency. Moreover, the optimal h* varies with the aspect ratio, the amplitude-to-chord ratio and the Lighthill number. This indicates that the shape and kinematics of propulsors are intertwined, that is, there are specific kinematics that are tailored to the shape of a propulsor in order to maximize its propulsive efficiency.",TRUE
Tillandsia-Inspired Hygroscopic Photothermal Organogels for Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting.,"Tillandsia species with degenerated roots have evolved into hygroscopic leaves that absorb moisture from air.

Sequence comparisons with other tick defensins reveal amn to be shorter (6 bp or 2 amino acids) than the Ixodes scapularis Linnaeus (Acari: Ixodidae) and Dermacentor variabilis (Say) (Acari: Ixodidae) defensin sequences. The amercin prepropeptide has 60.8% and 59.5% similarity with the I. scapularis and D. variabilis prepropeptides, respectively, whereas the mature amercin peptide has 73.7% and 71.1% similarity with the mature peptides of these ticks. Similarity with other tick defensins ranges from 42% to 71%. In A. americanum, defensin transcript was found in the midgut, fat body and salivary gland tissues, as well as in the haemocytes. Defensin transcript was also present in early‚Äêstage eggs (less than 48 h old), late‚Äêstage eggs (approximately 2 weeks old), larvae and nymphs of A. americanum and I. scapularis, both of which are vector‚Äêcompetent for Borrelia spirochetes.",TRUE
To bend a coralline: effect of joint morphology on flexibility and stress amplification in an articulated calcified seaweed,"SUMMARY Previous studies have demonstrated that fleshy seaweeds resist wave-induced drag forces in part by being flexible. Flexibility allows fronds to `go with the flow', reconfiguring into streamlined shapes and reducing frond area projected into flow. This paradigm extends even to articulated coralline algae, which produce calcified fronds that are flexible only because they have distinct joints (genicula). The evolution of flexibility through genicula was a major event that allowed articulated coralline algae to grow elaborate erect fronds in wave-exposed habitats. Here we describe the mechanics of genicula in the articulated coralline Calliarthron and demonstrate how segmentation affects bending performance and amplifies bending stresses within genicula. A numerical model successfully predicted deflections of articulated fronds by assuming genicula to be assemblages of cables connecting adjacent calcified segments (intergenicula). By varying the dimensions of genicula in the model, we predicted the optimal genicular morphology that maximizes flexibility while minimizing stress amplification. Morphological dimensions of genicula most prone to bending stresses (i.e. genicula near the base of fronds) match model predictions.",TRUE
Torque and Angular-Momentum Transfer in Merging Rotating Bose-Einstein Condensates.,"When rotating classical fluid drops merge together, angular momentum can be advected from one to another due to the viscous shear flow at the drop interface. It remains elusive what the corresponding mechanism is in inviscid quantum fluids such as Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Here we report our theoretical study of an initially static BEC merging with a rotating BEC in three-dimensional space along the rotational axis. We show that a solitonlike sheet, resembling a corkscrew, spontaneously emerges at the interface. Rapid angular-momentum transfer at a constant rate universally proportional to the initial angular-momentum density is observed. Strikingly, this transfer does not necessarily involve fluid advection or drifting of the quantized vortices. We reveal that the corkscrew structure can exert a torque that directly creates angular momentum in the static BEC and annihilates angular momentum in the rotating BEC. Uncovering this intriguing angular-momentum transport mechanism may benefit our understanding of various coherent matter-wave systems, spanning from atomtronics on chips to dark matter BECs at cosmic scales.",TRUE
Total Internal Reflection Accounts for the Bright Color of the Saharan Silver Ant,"The Saharan silver ant Cataglyphis bombycina is one of the terrestrial living organisms best adapted to tolerate high temperatures. It has recently been shown that the hairs covering the ant‚Äôs dorsal body part are responsible for its silvery appearance. The hairs have a triangular cross-section with two corrugated surfaces allowing a high optical reflection in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) range of the spectrum while maximizing heat emissivity in the mid-infrared (MIR). Those two effects account for remarkable thermoregulatory properties, enabling the ant to maintain a lower thermal steady state and to cope with the high temperature of its natural habitat. In this paper, we further investigate how geometrical optical and high reflection properties account for the bright silver color of C. bombycina. Using optical ray-tracing models and attenuated total reflection (ATR) experiments, we show that, for a large range of incidence angles, total internal reflection (TIR) conditions are satisfied on the basal face of each hair for light entering and exiting through its upper faces. The reflection properties of the hairs are further enhanced by the presence of the corrugated surface, giving them an almost total specular reflectance for most incidence angles. We also show that hairs provide an almost 10-fold increase in light reflection, and we confirm experimentally that they are responsible for a lower internal body temperature under incident sunlight. Overall, this study improves our understanding of the optical mechanisms responsible for the silver color of C. bombycina and the remarkable thermoregulatory properties of the hair coat covering the ant‚Äôs body.",TRUE

Trabecular bone scales allometrically in mammals and birds,"Many bones are supported internally by a latticework of trabeculae. Scaling of whole bone length and diameter has been extensively investigated, but scaling of the trabecular network is not well characterized. We analysed trabecular geometry in the femora of 90 terrestrial mammalian and avian species with body masses ranging from 3 g to 3400 kg. We found that bone volume fraction does not scale substantially with animal size, while trabeculae in larger animals' femora are thicker, further apart and fewer per unit volume than in smaller animals. Finite element modelling indicates that trabecular scaling does not alter the bulk stiffness of trabecular bone, but does alter strain within trabeculae under equal applied loads. Allometry of bone's trabecular tissue may contribute to the skeleton's ability to withstand load, without incurring the physiological or mechanical costs of increasing bone mass.",TRUE
Transformation mechanism of amorphous calcium carbonate into calcite in the sea urchin larval spicule,"Sea urchin larval spicules transform amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) into calcite single crystals. The mechanism of transformation is enigmatic: the transforming spicule displays both amorphous and crystalline properties, with no defined crystallization front. Here, we use X-ray photoelectron emission spectromicroscopy with probing size of 40‚Äì200 nm. We resolve 3 distinct mineral phases: An initial short-lived, presumably hydrated ACC phase, followed by an intermediate transient form of ACC, and finally the biogenic crystalline calcite phase. The amorphous and crystalline phases are juxtaposed, often appearing in adjacent sites at a scale of tens of nanometers. We propose that the amorphous-crystal transformation propagates in a tortuous path through preexisting 40- to 100-nm amorphous units, via a secondary nucleation mechanism.",TRUE
Transitive inference in Polistes paper wasps,"Transitive inference (TI) is a form of logical reasoning that involves using known relationships to infer unknown relationships (A > B; B > C; then A > C). TI has been found in a wide range of vertebrates but not in insects. Here, we test whether Polistes dominula and Polistes metricus paper wasps can solve a TI problem. Wasps were trained to discriminate between five elements in series (A0B‚àí, B0C‚àí, C0D‚àí, D0E‚àí), then tested on novel, untrained pairs (B versus D). Consistent with TI, wasps chose B more frequently than D. Wasps organized the trained stimuli into an implicit hierarchy and used TI to choose between untrained pairs. Species that form social hierarchies like Polistes may be predisposed to spontaneously organize information along a common underlying dimension. This work contributes to a growing body of evidence that the miniature nervous system of insects does not limit sophisticated behaviours.",TRUE
Transpiration Through the Cuticle of Insects,"Transpiration through the cuticle of insects is restricted by a thin layer of orientated wax on the outer surface of the epicuticle. In some insects at least this wax layer is covered by a thin layer of cement.When heated to a certain temperature the wax layer shows an abrupt increase in permeability to water. This ‚Äòcritical temperature‚Äô varies widely in different species and in different stages of the same species. It is highest in those insects which are most resistant to desiccation.In the newly formed puparium of Calliphora the impermeable film of wax is wholly superficial as in other insects. But after pupation the main impermeable layer is on the surface of the true pupa. The critical temperature of the pupa is much higher than that of the puparium.Abrasion of the wax layer results in a great increase in transpiration through the cuticle. Inert dusts cause the desiccation of insects by getting between the moving surfaces of the cuticle and abrading the wax layer. Such dusts in stationary contact with the cuticle will not remove the wax by adsorption; hence they are without action on dead or motionless insects.(The cockroach is an exception to this. Here the water proof layer is a soft grease, freely exposed on the surface; it is largely removed by adsorption on to the dusts.)The places where the wax has been abraded can be demonstrated by immersing the insect in ammoniacal silver solution. The phenol-containing epicuticle stains deep brown only where the protective layer of wax has been removed.Although the epicuticle shows no visible injury as the result of abrasion, the underlying cells react as though they had been wounded, and growth processes in the epidermis are affected.Insect larvae from the soil show great but variable evaporation of water. This is the result of abrasion of the cuticle by soil particles. If the wireworm Agriotes is allowed to moult out of contact with the soil it has an impermeable cuticle like other insects.After abrasion the living insect is able to secrete more wax through the substance of the cuticle and so to restore its impermeability. Adsorption of the wax by dusts while it is being secreted interferes with this process of recovery.Lipoid solvents remove the wax layer from the surface and so increase transpiration. A long series of wetting agents and detergents has been tested. They show widely different effects on permeability of the cuticle to water.Removal of the wax layer by means of abrasive dusts or suitable detergents increases the rate of entry of insecticides through the cuticle.",TRUE
"Traps of carnivorous pitcher plants as a habitat: composition of the fluid, biodiversity and mutualistic activities.","BACKGROUNDCarnivorous pitcher plants (CPPs) use cone-shaped leaves to trap animals for nutrient supply but are not able to kill all intruders of their traps. Numerous species, ranging from bacteria to vertrebrates, survive and propagate in the otherwise deadly traps. This paper reviews the literature on phytotelmata of CPPs.PITCHERFluid as a Habitat The volumes of pitchers range from 0¬∑2 mL to 1¬∑5 L. In Nepenthes and Cephalotus, the fluid is secreted by the trap; the other genera collect rain water. The fluid is usually acidic, rich in O(2) and contains digestive enzymes. In some taxa, toxins or detergents are found, or the fluid is extremely viscous. In Heliamphora or Sarracenia, the fluid differs little from pure water.INQUILINEDiversity Pitcher inquilines comprise bacteria, protozoa, algae, fungi, rotifers, crustaceans, arachnids, insects and amphibia. The dominant groups are protists and Dipteran larvae. The various species of CPPs host different sets of inquilines. Sarracenia purpurea hosts up to 165 species of inquilines, followed by Nepenthes ampullaria with 59 species, compared with only three species from Brocchinia reducta. Reasons for these differences include size, the life span of the pitcher as well as its fluid. MUTUALISTIC: Activities Inquilines closely interact with their host. Some live as parasites, but the vast majority are mutualists. Beneficial activities include secretion of enzymes, feeding on the plant's prey and successive excretion of inorganic nutrients, mechanical break up of the prey, removal of excessive prey and assimilation of atmospheric N(2).CONCLUSIONSThere is strong evidence that CPPs influence their phytotelm. Two strategies can be distinguished: (1) Nepenthes and Cephalotus produce acidic, toxic or digestive fluids and host a limited diversity of inquilines. (2) Genera without efficient enzymes such as Sarracenia or Heliamphora host diverse organisms and depend to a large extent on their symbionts for prey utilization.",TRUE
Tree shrew lavatories: a novel nitrogen sequestration strategy in a tropical pitcher plant,"Nepenthes pitcher plants are typically carnivorous, producing pitchers with varying combinations of epicuticular wax crystals, viscoelastic fluids and slippery peristomes to trap arthropod prey, especially ants. However, ant densities are low in tropical montane habitats, thereby limiting the potential benefits of the carnivorous syndrome. Nepenthes lowii, a montane species from Borneo, produces two types of pitchers that differ greatly in form and function. Pitchers produced by immature plants conform to the ‚Äòtypical‚Äô Nepenthes pattern, catching arthropod prey. However, pitchers produced by mature N. lowii plants lack the features associated with carnivory and are instead visited by tree shrews, which defaecate into them after feeding on exudates that accumulate on the pitcher lid. We tested the hypothesis that tree shrew faeces represent a significant nitrogen (N) source for N. lowii, finding that it accounts for between 57 and 100 per cent of foliar N in mature N. lowii plants. Thus, N. lowii employs a diversified N sequestration strategy, gaining access to a N source that is not available to sympatric congeners. The interaction between N. lowii and tree shrews appears to be a mutualism based on the exchange of food sources that are scarce in their montane habitat.",TRUE
Two chemosensory receptors together mediate carbon dioxide detection in Drosophila,"Blood-feeding insects, including the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, use highly specialized and sensitive olfactory systems to locate their hosts. This is accomplished by detecting and following plumes of volatile host emissions, which include carbon dioxide (CO2). CO2 is sensed by a population of olfactory sensory neurons in the maxillary palps of mosquitoes and in the antennae of the more genetically tractable fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster. The molecular identity of the chemosensory CO2 receptor, however, remains unknown. Here we report that CO2-responsive neurons in Drosophila co-express a pair of chemosensory receptors, Gr21a and Gr63a, at both larval and adult life stages. We identify mosquito homologues of Gr21a and Gr63a, GPRGR22 and GPRGR24, and show that these are co-expressed in A. gambiae maxillary palps. We show that Gr21a and Gr63a together are sufficient for olfactory CO2-chemosensation in Drosophila. Ectopic expression of Gr21a and Gr63a together confers CO2 sensitivity on CO2-insensitive olfactory neurons, but neither gustatory receptor alone has this function. Mutant flies lacking Gr63a lose both electrophysiological and behavioural responses to CO2. Knowledge of the molecular identity of the insect olfactory CO2 receptors may spur the development of novel mosquito control strategies designed to take advantage of this unique and critical olfactory pathway. This in turn could bolster the worldwide fight against malaria and other insect-borne diseases.",TRUE
Type-I collagen fibrils: From growth morphology to local order,"Abstract.The length of type-I collagen fibrils in solution increases through the development and progress of pointed tips appearing successively at the two ends of an axis-symmetric shaft with constant diameter. Those tips, respectively fine ($\alpha$Œ±) or coarse ($ \beta$Œ≤) have opposite molecular orientations. The $\alpha$Œ±-pointed tips, the first to appear, are particularly remarkable as they all show, on most of their length, a common parabolic profile which stays constant during the growth. Assuming that the latter occurs by lateral accretion of individual molecules in staggered configuration, we propose to give account of this prominent morphological feature along a purely geometrical argument, the profile of a tip being linked to the shape of the trajectories followed all along the accretion process. Among several possible trajectories, Fermat spirals lead to a parabolic profile in perfect agreement with the one observed for $\alpha$Œ±-pointed tips. This is to be put in relation with the presence of such spirals in phyllotactic patterns which ensure the best packing efficiency in cases of axis-symmetry, which is indeed that of dense collagen fibrils. Moreover, those patterns are structured by concentric circles of dislocations, constitutive of the structure itself, whose behaviour might contribute to the mechanical properties of the fibrils.Graphical abstract",TRUE
Ultra-black Camouflage in Deep-Sea Fishes,"At oceanic depths >200 m, there is little ambient sunlight, but bioluminescent organisms provide another light source that can reveal animals to visual predators and prey [1-4]. Transparency and mirrored surfaces-common camouflage strategies under the diffuse solar illumination of shallower waters-are conspicuous when illuminated by directed bioluminescent sources due to reflection from the body surface [5, 6]. Pigmentation allows animals to absorb light from bioluminescent sources, rendering them visually undetectable against the dark background of the deep sea [5]. We present evidence suggesting pressure to reduce reflected bioluminescence led to the evolution of ultra-black skin (reflectance <0.5%) in 16 species of deep-sea fishes across seven distantly related orders. Histological data suggest this low reflectance is mediated by a continuous layer of densely packed melanosomes in the exterior-most layer of the dermis [7, 8] and that this layer lacks the unpigmented gaps between pigment cells found in other darkly colored fishes [9-13]. Using finite-difference, time-domain modeling and comparisons with melanosomes found in other ectothermic vertebrates [11, 13-21], we find the melanosomes making up the layer in these ultra-black species are optimized in size and shape to minimize reflectance. Low reflectance results from melanosomes scattering light within the layer, increasing the optical path length and therefore light absorption by the melanin. By reducing reflectance, ultra-black fish can reduce the sighting distance of visual predators more than 6-fold compared to fish with 2% reflectance. This biological example of efficient light absorption via a simple architecture of strongly absorbing and highly scattering particles may inspire new ultra-black materials.",TRUE
Ultra-fast underwater suction traps,"Carnivorous aquatic Utricularia species catch small prey animals using millimetre-sized underwater suction traps, which have fascinated scientists since Darwin's early work on carnivorous plants.

The exceptional trapping speed‚Äîfar above human visual perception‚Äîimpeded profound investigations until now. Using high-speed video imaging and special microscopy techniques, we obtained fully time-resolved recordings of the door movement. We found that this unique trapping mechanism conducts suction in less than a millisecond and therefore ranks among the fastest plant movements known. Fluid acceleration reaches very high values, leaving little chance for prey animals to escape. We discovered that the door deformation is morphologically predetermined, and actually performs a buckling/unbuckling process, including a complete trapdoor curvature inversion. This process, which we predict using dynamical simulations and simple theoretical models, is highly reproducible: the traps are autonomously repetitive as they fire spontaneously after 5‚Äì20 h and reset actively to their ready-to-catch condition.",TRUE

"Ultrasound-triggered, flight-gated evasive maneuvers in the praying mantis Parasphendale agrionina. II. Tethered flight","In tethered flight, Parasphendale agrionina (Gerst.) males respond to ultrasonic stimuli with a unique suite of behaviors that includes full extension of the forelegs, strong dorsiflexion of the abdomen, a head roll, a 5% decrease in wingbeat frequency and a 33% increase in forewing excursion. Latency for the foreleg extension averages 66 ms while the latency to onset of yaw is 174 ms. The direction of the turn is unrelated to the location of the speaker. Yaw magnitude and latency are only weakly related to sound pressure level, and variability in these and other parameters is high. The behavior shows moderately sharp tuning to 40‚Äì60 kHz with a lowest mean threshold of 60 dB SPL. A male will not respond to ultrasound unless in flight, and the context-gating is independent of sensory input from the tarsi. Several components of the in-flight evasive behavior resemble defensive displays on the ground, and we suggest that this mantis has responded to predation pressure from bats with both flight-derived maneuvers and an aerial deimatic display.",TRUE
Ultrastructural architecture of the microtrichia of the insect cuticle,"The ultrastructure of the microtrichia (MT) of the insect cuticle was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). After dissolving the protein matrix of chitin-protein microfibrils with NaOH, the orientation of the axial chitin fibers was three-dimensionally demonstrated. Microfibrils of the outermost exocuticular lamella lie parallel to the slope of the cone surface of the MT and rotate slightly on the top of the MT. Microfibrils of the external lamella of the transitional area between planar cuticle and conical cuticle of the MT corresponded to the shape of the surface within one lamella and preferred directions of MT's microfibrils in the successive lamella rotated. In the deeper layers of the cuticle, the rotation of both the microfibrils and successive lamella results in the twisted straw architecture of the microfibrils' composition within the MT. The deepest microfibrils that are located close to the axis of the MT form compact clusters of fibrils (1.0‚Äì1.5 Œºm length). The twisted-straw architecture of microfibrils in the MT is derived from principles of development of extracellular fibrous composites. It is suggested, however, that this architecture has an additional functional significance as a strategic design with particular mechanical properties. J.

Ultrastructure and permeability characteristics of the membranes of mucous granules of the hagfish.,"Mucous granules secreted by the slime glands of the hagfish. Eptatretus stouti, were studied after ultrarapid cryofixation and freeze substitution in diverse media (osmium tetroxide in acetone; several aqueous glutaraldehyde-based media with or without osmium). Only freeze substitution with osmium tetroxide-acetone preserved the granules intact, allowing visualization of its single unit membrane. Tests of the rupture or stability of freshly secreted mucous granules in sea water and other aqueous media showed the membranes of the granules are permeable to all inorganic cations tested, ranging in relative mass from ammonium to barium. They are permeable to the univalent anions chloride, nitrate, and bicarbonate, but not to the di- or trivalent anions sulfate, phosphate, and citrate. Moreover, in solutions where nonpenetrant anions were present, rupture occurred if the osmotic pressure was below a critical level (about 800 mOsmol/l). The structural and permeability characteristics of the granules account for the explosive speed with which they rupture, releasing their mucous contents, on contact with sea water.",TRUE
Ultrastructure of the thoracic dorso-medial field (TDM) in the elytra-to-body arresting mechanism in Tenebrionid Beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae),"Beetles with flying ability lock their elytra (forewings) to the thorax or/and abdomen using complex locking devices. These structures are often supplemented with microtrichia fields of the inner surface of the elytra and adjacent parts of the pterothorax. The present study provides information about the ultrastructure of microtrichia of the dorso-medial fields of the thorax (TDM) in tenebrionid beetles (Tribolium castaneum, Zophobas rugipes). Epidermal cells located under the TDM field contain large electron-lucent vesicles connected to rough endoplasmic reticulum. Microtrichia and underlying cuticle of the TDM have a high density of pore channels, which are responsible for transport of an epidermal secretion onto the TDM surface. In order to show the presence of the secretion on the cuticle surface, TDM fields of air-dried specimens were compared with those in specimens after two treatments, such as (1) dehydration in ethanol and acetone, and (2) dental-wax-cast technique applied to living beetles. This revealed the presence of the nonvolatile film on the intact microtrichial surface. Possible functions of this film are suggested to be (1) the increase of adhesive forces in the contact area and (2) providing soft coupling and release of two corresponding parts of the elytra-locking device.

Ultraviolet reflecting photonic microstructures in the King Penguin beak,"King and emperor penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus and Aptenodytes forsteri) are the only species of marine birds so far known to reflect ultraviolet (UV) light from their beaks. Unlike humans, most birds perceive UV light and several species communicate using the near UV spectrum. Indeed, UV reflectance in addition to the colour of songbird feathers has been recognized as an important signal when choosing a mate. The king penguin is endowed with several highly coloured ornaments, notably its beak horn and breast and auricular plumage, but only its beak reflects UV, a property considered to influence its sexual attraction. Because no avian UV-reflecting pigments have yet been identified, the origin of such reflections is probably structural. In an attempt to identify the structures that give rise to UV reflectance, we combined reflectance spectrophotometry and morphological analysis by both light and electron microscopy, after experimental removal of surface layers of the beak horn. Here, we characterize for the first time a multilayer reflector photonic microstructure that produces the UV reflections in the king penguin beak.",TRUE
"Uncovering the Core Microbiome and Distribution of Palmerolide in Synoicum adareanum Across the Anvers Island Archipelago, Antarctica","Polar marine ecosystems hold the potential for bioactive compound biodiscovery, based on their untapped macro- and microorganism diversity. Characterization of polar benthic marine invertebrate-associated microbiomes is limited to few studies. This study was motivated by our interest in better understanding the microbiome structure and composition of the ascidian, Synoicum adareanum, in which palmerolide A (PalA), a bioactive macrolide with specificity against melanoma, was isolated. PalA bears structural resemblance to a hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketide that has similarities to microbially-produced macrolides. We conducted a spatial survey to assess both PalA levels and microbiome composition in S. adareanum in a region of the Antarctic Peninsula near Anvers Island (64¬∞46‚Ä≤ S, 64¬∞03‚Ä≤ W). PalA was ubiquitous and abundant across a collection of 21 ascidians (3 subsamples each) sampled from seven sites across the Anvers Island Archipelago. The microbiome composition (V3‚ÄìV4 16S rRNA gene sequence variants) of these 63 samples revealed a core suite of 21 bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs)‚Äî20 of which were distinct from regional bacterioplankton. ASV co-occurrence analysis across all 63 samples yielded subgroups of taxa that may be interacting biologically (interacting subsystems) and, although the levels of PalA detected were not found to correlate with specific sequence variants, the core members appeared to occur in a preferred optimum and tolerance range of PalA levels. These results, together with an analysis of the biosynthetic potential of related microbiome taxa, describe a conserved, high-latitude core microbiome with unique composition and substantial promise for natural product biosynthesis that likely influences the ecology of the holobiont.",TRUE
Under- and over-water halves of Gyrinidae beetle eyes harbor different corneal nanocoatings providing adaptation to the water and air environments,"Whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae) inhabit water surfaces and possess unique eyes which are split into the overwater and underwater parts.

We find that corneae of the overwater ommatidia are covered with maze-like nanostructures, while the corneal surface of the underwater eyes is smooth. We further show that the overwater nanostructures possess no anti-wetting, but the anti-reflective properties with the spectral preference in the range of 450‚Äì600‚ÄÖnm. These findings illustrate the adaptation of the corneal nanocoating of the two halves of an insect's eye to two different environments.

Understanding stress concentration about a nutrient foramen.,"We investigated the microstructural basis of a reduced stress concentration around the primary nutrient foramen of the equine third metacarpus. We quantified the spatial variations of compositional parameters (mineral content, volume fraction, histological architecture, and osteonal trajectories) from microradiographs and polarizing microscopic images of thin sections. These variations in composition and organization in turn cause variations in mechanical properties of cortical bone. We modeled the spatially inhomogeneous anisotropic elastic properties based on the measured compositional parameters and used the properties as inputs to a finite element model of the bone containing the foramen. This model, spatially constructed solely from the microscopic images, was subsequently validated by our mechanical test results. We found that: (1) a primary mechanism for stress concentration reduction appears to be due to an increased compliance near the foramen: the sharp discontinuity represented by the hole is softened by embedding it in a compliant region; (2) a reinforcing ring of increased stiffness exists at some distance from the foramen; and (3) a ring of lamellar bone exists along the foramen inside edge, which might serve to reduce the chance of cracks forming there. Our work is allowing us to design biomimetic structures with holes by mimicking the microstructure near the nutrient foramen.",TRUE
Underwater attachment using hairs: the functioning of spatula and sucker setae from male diving beetles,"Males of Dytiscinae beetles use specialized adhesive setae to adhere to female elytra during underwater courtship. This coevolution of male setae and female elytra has attracted much attention since Darwin. However, there has been little examination of their biomechanical functioning despite increasing knowledge on biofibrillar adhesion. Here, we report and compare, for the first time, the mechanisms of underwater attachment using two hair types, the primitive spatula and derived ‚Äòpassive‚Äô sucker, found in male diving beetles. Results from interspecific scaling of protarsal palettes and adhesion by single seta suggest better performance in the later-evolved circular (sucker) setae. Spatula setae with a modified shallow sucker and channels use the combined mechanisms of suction and viscous resistance for adhesion. Velocity-dependent adhesion provides sufficient control for resisting the female's erratic movements while also detaching easily through slow peeling. Direction-dependent shear resistance helps reorient setae surfaces into a preferred direction for effective adhesion. Seta deformation using different mechanisms for circular and spatula setae reduces the force that is transmitted to the contact interface. A softer spring in spatula setae explains their adhesion at lower preloads and assists in complete substrate contact. Attachment mechanisms revealed in adhesive setae with modified spatula and passive suckers provide insights for bioinspired designs of underwater attachment devices.",TRUE
Underwater locomotion in a terrestrial beetle: combination of surface de-wetting and capillary forces,"For the first time, we report the remarkable ability of the terrestrial leaf beetle Gastrophysa viridula to walk on solid substrates under water. These beetles have adhesive setae on their feet that produce a secretory fluid having a crucial role in adhesion on land. In air, adhesion is produced by capillary forces between the fluid-covered setae and the substrate. In general, capillary forces do not contribute to adhesion under water. However, our observations showed that these beetles may use air bubbles trapped between their adhesive setae to walk on flooded, inclined substrata or even under water. Beetle adhesion to hydrophilic surfaces under water was lower than that in air, whereas adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces under water was comparable to that in air. Oil-covered hairy pads had a pinning effect, retaining the air bubbles on their feet. Bubbles in contact with the hydrophobic substrate de-wetted the substrate and produced capillary adhesion. Additional capillary forces are generated by the pad's liquid bridges between the foot and the substrate. Inspired by this idea, we designed an artificial silicone polymer structure with underwater adhesive properties.",TRUE
Undulation enables gliding in flying snakes,"When flying snakes glide, they use aerial undulation. To determine if aerial undulation is a flight control strategy or a non-functional behavioural vestige of lateral undulation, we measured snake glides using high-speed motion capture and developed a new dynamical model of gliding. Reconstructions of the snake‚Äôs wing-body reveal that aerial undulation is composed of horizontal and vertical waves, whose phases differ by 90¬∞ and whose frequencies differ by a factor of two. Using these results, we developed a three-dimensional mathematical model of snake flight that incorporates aerodynamic and inertial effects. Although simulated glides without undulation attained some horizontal distance, they are biologically unrealistic because they failed due to roll and pitch instabilities. In contrast, the inclusion of undulation stabilized the rotational motion and markedly increased glide performance. This work demonstrates that aerial undulation in snakes serves a different function than known uses of undulation in other animals, and suggests a new template of control for dynamic flying robots. Observations of flying snakes inform the development of a dynamical model of gliding taking undulation into account. This work suggests that aerial undulation has a different function in snakes than in other animals.",TRUE
Unique Structural Features Facilitate Lizard Tail Autotomy,"Autotomy refers to the voluntary shedding of a body part; a renowned example is tail loss among lizards as a response to attempted predation. Although many aspects of lizard tail autotomy have been studied, the detailed morphology and mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we showed that tail shedding by the Tokay gecko (Gekko gecko) and the associated extracellular matrix (ECM) rupture were independent of proteolysis. Instead, lizard caudal autotomy relied on biological adhesion facilitated by surface microstructures. Results based on bio-imaging techniques demonstrated that the tail of Gekko gecko was pre-severed at distinct sites and that its structural integrity depended on the adhesion between these segments.",TRUE

We provide evidence that UpaB can interact with glycosaminoglycans and host fibronectin. Unique modifications to its core Œ≤-helical structure create a groove on one side of the protein for interaction with glycosaminoglycans, while the opposite face can bind fibronectin. Our findings reveal far greater diversity in the autotransporter Œ≤-helix than previously thought, and suggest that this domain can interact with host macromolecules. The relevance of these interactions during infection remains unclear.Autotransporter proteins are localised to the bacterial surface and promote colonisation of host epithelial surfaces.

Universal elastic mechanism for stinger design,"Living organisms use stingers that vary in length L over eight orders of magnitude, from a few tens of nanometres to several metres, across a wide array of biological taxa.

Universal metabolic constraints shape the evolutionary ecology of diving in animals,"Diving as a lifestyle has evolved on multiple occasions when air-breathing terrestrial animals invaded the aquatic realm, and diving performance shapes the ecology and behaviour of all air-breathing aquatic taxa, from small insects to great whales. Using the largest dataset yet assembled, we show that maximum dive duration increases predictably with body mass in both ectotherms and endotherms. Compared to endotherms, ectotherms can remain submerged for longer, but the mass scaling relationship for dive duration is much steeper in endotherms than in ectotherms. These differences in diving allometry can be fully explained by inherent differences between the two groups in their metabolic rate and how metabolism scales with body mass and temperature. Therefore, we suggest that similar constraints on oxygen storage and usage have shaped the evolutionary ecology of diving in all air-breathing animals, irrespective of their evolutionary history and metabolic mode. The steeper scaling relationship between body mass and dive duration in endotherms not only helps explain why the largest extant vertebrate divers are endothermic rather than ectothermic, but also fits well with the emerging consensus that large extinct tetrapod divers (e.g. plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs and mosasaurs) were endothermic.",TRUE
"Uptake of Water by the Lizard, Moloch horridus","Moloch horridusis an agamid lizard living in the desert regions of Western and South Australia.

This ability of absorbing water through the skin is characteristic of many Amphibia and is correlated with a ready loss of water by the same route2.

UV protective coatings: A botanical approach,"Solar UV radiation is harmful to many biological systems, as well as all kind of technical applications. UV protective coatings are commonly utilised to shield many susceptible substances. In an attempt to learn from nature we demonstrate that for the Pinus mugo subsp. mugo (dwarf mountain pine) the cuticular wax layer provides UV protection. This biological coating contains chromophores that absorb UV radiation in such a way that it removes the most harmful UV-B and UV-A from the solar spectrum received by the plant and does not lower the received PAR (photosynthetically active radiation). In addition, the P. mugo grown at high elevations in the Alps has a cuticular wax coat that also contains fluorsphores, which convert the harmful solar UV into blue light. This additional blue light can be utilised for photosynthesis in low-light conditions, which gives the P. mugo ecological advantage over other Alpine species. The principle of turning useless or even harmful radiation into useful energy sets an example for new biological based coatings.",TRUE
Variability in plant nutrients reduces insect herbivore performance,"The performance and population dynamics of insect herbivores depend on the nutritive and defensive traits of their host plants. The literature on plant‚Äìherbivore interactions focuses on plant trait mean values, but recent studies showing the importance of plant genetic diversity for herbivores suggest that plant trait variance may be equally important. The consequences of plant trait variance for herbivore performance, however, have been largely overlooked. Here we report an extensive assessment of the effects of within-population plant trait variance on herbivore performance using 457 performance datasets from 53 species of insect herbivores. We show that variance in plant nutritive traits substantially reduces mean herbivore performance via non-linear averaging of performance relationships that were overwhelmingly concave down. By contrast, relationships between herbivore performance and plant defence levels were typically linear, with variance in plant defence not affecting herbivore performance via non-linear averaging. Our results demonstrate that plants contribute to the suppression of herbivore populations through variable nutrient levels, not just by having low average quality as is typically thought. We propose that this phenomenon could play a key role in the suppression of herbivore populations in natural systems, and that increased nutrient heterogeneity within agricultural crops could contribute to the sustainable control of insect pests in agroecosystems.",TRUE
Variation in annual and lifetime reproductive success of lance-tailed manakins: alpha experience mitigates effects of senescence on siring success,"The causes of variation in individual reproductive success over a lifetime are not well understood. In long-lived vertebrates, reproductive output usually increases during early adulthood, but it is difficult to disentangle the roles of development and learning on this gain of reproductive success. Lekking lance-tailed manakins provide an opportunity to separate these processes, as the vast majority of male reproduction occurs after a bird obtains alpha status and maintains a display area in the lek, but the age at which males achieve alpha status varies widely. Using 11 years of longitudinal data on age, social status and genetic siring success, I assessed the factors influencing variation in siring success by individuals over their lifetimes. The data show increases in annual reproductive success with both age and alpha experience. At advanced ages, these gains were offset by senescence in fecundity. Individual ontogeny, rather than compositional change of the population, generated a nonlinear relationship of breeding tenure with lifetime success; age of assuming alpha status was unrelated to tenure as a breeder, or success in the alpha role. Importantly, these findings suggest that social experience can mitigate the negative effects of senescence in older breeders.",TRUE
Venom kinematics during prey capture in Conus: the biomechanics of a rapid injection system,"SUMMARY Cone snails use an extensile, tubular proboscis as a conduit to deliver a potent cocktail of bioactive venom peptides into their prey. Previous studies have focused mainly on understanding the venom's role in prey capture but successful prey capture requires both rapid physiological and biomechanical mechanisms. Conus catus, a fish-hunting species, uses a high-speed hydraulic mechanism to inject its hollow, spear-like radular tooth into prey. We take an integrated approach to investigating the biomechanics of this process by coupling kinematic studies with morphological analyses. Taking advantage of the opaque venom and translucent proboscis of a mollusc-hunting juvenile cone snail, Conus pennaceus, we have determined that a high-speed prey capture mechanism is not unique to cone species that hunt fish prey. Two morphological structures were found to play crucial roles in this process. A constriction of the lumen near the tip of the proboscis, composed of tall epithelial cells densely packed with microfilaments, impedes forward movement of the radular tooth prior to its propulsion. Proximal to the constriction, a muscular sphincter was found to regulate venom flow and pressurization in the proboscis. In C. pennaceus, the rapid appearance and flushing of venom within the proboscis during prey capture suggests a mechanism involving the delivery of a discrete quantity of venom. The interplay between these elements provides a unique and effective biomechanical injection system for the fast-acting cone snail venom peptides.",TRUE
Versatility of Turing patterns potentiates rapid evolution in tarsal attachment microstructures of stick and leaf insects (Phasmatodea),"In its evolution, the diverse group of stick and leaf insects (Phasmatodea) has undergone a rapid radiation. These insects evolved specialized structures to adhere to different surfaces typical for their specific ecological environments. The cuticle of their tarsal attachment pads (euplantulae) is known to possess a high diversity of attachment microstructures (AMS) which are suggested to reflect ecological specializations of different groups within phasmids. However, the origin of these microstructures and their developmental background remain largely unknown. Here, based on the detailed scanning electron microscopy study of pad surfaces, we present a theoretical approach to mathematically model an outstanding diversity of phasmid AMS using the reaction‚Äìdiffusion model by Alan Turing. In general, this model explains pattern formation in nature. For the first time, we were able to identify eight principal patterns and simulate the transitions among these. In addition, intermediate transitional patterns were predicted by the model. The ease of transformation suggests a high adaptability of the microstructures that might explain the rapid evolution of pad characters. We additionally discuss the functional morphology of the different microstructures and their assumed advantages in the context of the ecological background of species.",TRUE
Vertical jumping in Galago senegalensis: the quest for an obligate mechanical power amplifier,"Bushbabies ( Galago senegalensis ) are renowned for their phenomenal jumping capacity. It was postulated that mechanical power amplification must be involved. Dynamic analysis of the vertical jumps performed by two bushbabies confirms the need for a power amplifier. Inverse dynamics coupled to a geometric musculo‚Äìskeletal model were used to elucidate the precise nature of the mechanism powering maximal vertical jumps. Most of the power required for jumping is delivered by the vastus muscle‚Äìtendon systems (knee extensor). Comparison with the external joint‚Äìpowers revealed, however, an important power transport from this extensor (about 65%) to the ankle and the midfoot via the bi‚Äìarticular calf muscles. Peak power output likely implies elastic recoil of the complex aponeurotic system of the vastus muscle. Patterns of changes in length and tension of the muscle‚Äìtendon complex during different phases of the jump were found which provide strong evidence for substantial power amplification (times 15). It is argued here that the multiple internal connective tissue sheets and attachment structures of the well‚Äìdeveloped bundles of the vastus muscle become increasingly stretched during preparatory crouching and throughout the extension phase, except for the last 13 ms of the push‚Äìoff (i.e. when power requirements peak). Then, tension in the knee extensors abruptly falls from its maximum, allowing the necessary fast recoil of the tensed tendon structures to occur.",TRUE
Viburnum tinus Fruits Use Lipids to Produce Metallic Blue Structural Color,"Viburnum tinus is an evergreen shrub that is native to the Mediterranean region but cultivated widely in Europe and around the world. It produces ripe metallic blue fruits throughout winter [1]. Despite its limited fleshy pulp [2], its high lipid content [3] makes it a valuable resource to the small birds [4] that act as its seed-dispersers [5]. Here, we find that the metallic blue appearance of the fruits is produced by globular lipid inclusions arranged in a disordered multilayer structure. This structure is embedded in the cell walls of the epicarp and underlaid with a dark layer of anthocyanin pigments. The presence of such large, organized lipid aggregates in plant cell walls represents a new mechanism for structural coloration and may serve as an honest signal of nutritional content.",TRUE
Viscosin-like lipopeptides from frog skin bacteria inhibit Aspergillus fumigatus and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis detected by imaging mass spectrometry and molecular networking,"Amphibian populations worldwide have declined and in some cases become extinct due to chytridiomycosis, a pandemic disease caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; however, some species have survived these fungal epidemics. Previous studies have suggested that the resistance of these species is due to the presence of cutaneous bacteria producing antifungal metabolites. As our understanding of these metabolites is still limited, we assessed the potential of such compounds against human-relevant fungi such as Aspergillus. In this work we isolated 201 bacterial strains from fifteen samples belonging to seven frog species collected in the highlands of Panama and tested them against Aspergillus fumigatus. Among the 29 bacterial isolates that exhibited antifungal activity, Pseudomonas cichorii showed the greatest inhibition. To visualize the distribution of compounds and identify them in the inhibition zone produced by P. cichorii, we employed MALDI imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) and MS/MS molecular networking. We identified viscosin and massetolides A, F, G and H in the inhibition zone. Furthermore, viscosin was isolated and evaluated in vitro against A. fumigatus and B. dendrobatidis showing MIC values of 62.50‚Äâ¬µg/mL and 31.25‚Äâ¬µg/mL, respectively. This is the first report of cyclic depsipeptides with antifungal activity isolated from frog cutaneous bacteria.",TRUE
"Visual pigments, oil droplets and cone photoreceptor distribution in the european starling (Sturnus vulgaris)","Microspectrophotometric measurements of retinal photoreceptors from the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) revealed four classes of single cone, containing visual pigments with wavelengths of maximum absorbance (<IMG src=""/images/symbols/lambda.gif"" WIDTH=""8"" HEIGHT=""12"" ALIGN=""BOTTOM"" NATURALSIZEFLAG= ""3"">max) at 563, 504, 449 and close to 362 nm.

The 449 nm <IMG src=""/images/symbols/lambda.gif"" WIDTH=""8"" HEIGHT=""12"" ALIGN=""BOTTOM"" NATURALSIZEFLAG=""3"">max pigment was associated with a 'colourless' oil droplet with peak measured absorptance below 400 nm. The ultraviolet-sensitive visual pigment was paired with a transparent oil droplet which showed no significant absorption above 350 nm. A single class of double cone was identified, both members of which contained the longwave-sensitive (<IMG src=""/images/symbols/lambda.gif"" WIDTH=""8"" HEIGHT= ""12"" ALIGN=""BOTTOM"" NATURALSIZEFLAG=""3"">max 563 nm) visual pigment. The principal member of the double cone contained an oil droplet with a topographically variable cut-off wavelength below 471 nm; the oil droplet found in the accessory member was only measured in the ventral retina and displayed three distinct peaks of absorption at approximately 430, 450 and 480 nm. Rod photoreceptors had a <IMG src=""/images/symbols/lambda.gif"" WIDTH=""8"" HEIGHT=""12"" ALIGN=""BOTTOM"" NATURALSIZEFLAG=""3"">max at 503 nm. A new polynomial for fitting visual pigment templates to ultraviolet-sensitive visual pigment data is given. Topographic density measurements of the different cone classes were made using Nitroblue-tetrazolium chloride to label selectively bleached photoreceptors. The two classes of shortwave-sensitive single cone were more abundant in the dorsal retina, and longwave-sensitive single cones were notably less abundant in the dorso-temporal region of the retina, which subserves binocular vision.",TRUE
Vividly coloured poppy flowers due to dense pigmentation and strong scattering in thin petals,"The flowers of poppies (Papaveraceae) exhibit bright colours, despite their thin and floppy petals. We investigated the optical properties of flowers of Papaver rhoeas, P. dubium, Meconopsis cambrica and Argemone polyanthemos using a combined approach of anatomy, spectrophotometry and optical modelling. The petals of Papaver flowers are composed of only three cell layers, an upper and lower epidermal layer, which are densely filled with pigment, and an unpigmented mesophyll layer. Dense pigmentation together with strong scattering structures, composed of serpentine cell walls and air cavities, cause the striking poppy colours. We discuss how various aspects of the optical signal contribute to the flower‚Äôs visibility to pollinators.",TRUE
Volumetric imaging of shark tail hydrodynamics reveals a three-dimensional dual-ring vortex wake structure,"Understanding how moving organisms generate locomotor forces is fundamental to the analysis of aerodynamic and hydrodynamic flow patterns that are generated during body and appendage oscillation. In the past, this has been accomplished using two-dimensional planar techniques that require reconstruction of three-dimensional flow patterns. We have applied a new, fully three-dimensional, volumetric imaging technique that allows instantaneous capture of wake flow patterns, to a classic problem in functional vertebrate biology: the function of the asymmetrical (heterocercal) tail of swimming sharks to capture the vorticity field within the volume swept by the tail. These data were used to test a previous three-dimensional reconstruction of the shark vortex wake estimated from two-dimensional flow analyses, and show that the volumetric approach reveals a different vortex wake not previously reconstructed from two-dimensional slices. The hydrodynamic wake consists of one set of dual-linked vortex rings produced per half tail beat. In addition, we use a simple passive shark-tail model under robotic control to show that the three-dimensional wake flows of the robotic tail differ from the active tail motion of a live shark, suggesting that active control of kinematics and tail stiffness plays a substantial role in the production of wake vortical patterns.",TRUE
Vortex wake and flight kinematics of a swift in cruising flight in a wind tunnel,"SUMMARY In this paper we describe the flight characteristics of a swift (Apus apus) in cruising flight at three different flight speeds (8.0, 8.4 and 9.2 m s‚Äì1) in a low turbulence wind tunnel. The wingbeat kinematics were recorded by high-speed filming and the wake of the bird was visualized by digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). Certain flight characteristics of the swift differ from those of previously studied species. As the flight speed increases, the angular velocity of the wingbeat remains constant, and so as the wingbeat amplitude increases, the frequency decreases accordingly, as though the flight muscles were contracting at a fixed rate. The wings are also comparatively inflexible and are flexed or retracted rather little during the upstroke. The upstroke is always aerodynamically active and this is reflected in the wake, where shedding of spanwise vorticity occurs throughout the wingbeat. Although the wake superficially resembles those of other birds in cruising flight, with a pair of trailing wingtip vortices connected by spanwise vortices, the continuous shedding of first positive vorticity during the downstroke and then negative vorticity during the upstroke suggests a wing whose circulation is gradually increasing and then decreasing during the wingbeat cycle. The wake (and implied wing aerodynamics) are not well described by discrete vortex loop models, but a new wake-based model, where incremental spanwise and streamwise variations of the wake impulse are integrated over the wingbeat, shows good agreement of the vertical momentum flux with the required weight support. The total drag was also estimated from the wake alone, and the calculated lift:drag ratio of approximately 13 for flapping flight is the highest measured yet for birds.",TRUE
Wake-induced ‚Äòslaloming‚Äô response explains exquisite sensitivity of seal whisker-like sensors,"Blindfolded harbour seals are able to use their uniquely shaped whiskers to track vortex wakes left by moving animals and identify objects that passed by 30 s earlier, an impressive feat, as the flow features have velocities as low as 1 mm s‚àí1 . The seals sense while swimming, hence their whiskers are sensitive enough to detect small-scale changes in the flow, while rejecting self-generated flow noise. Here we identify and illustrate a novel flow mechanism, causing a large-amplitude ‚Äòslaloming‚Äô whisker response, which allows artificial whiskers with the identical unique undulatory geometry as those of the harbour seal to detect the features of minute flow fluctuations when placed within wakes. Whereas in open water the whisker responds with very low-amplitude vibration, once within a wake, it oscillates with large amplitude and, importantly, its response frequency coincides with the Strouhal frequency of the upstream cylinder, making the detection of an upstream wake and an estimation of the size and shape of the wake-generating body possible. This mechanism has some similarities with the flow mechanisms observed in actively controlled propulsive foils within upstream wakes and trout swimming behind bluff cylinders in a stream, but there are also differences caused by the unique whisker morphology, which enables it to respond passively and within a much wider parametric range.",TRUE
"Water balance and osmoregulation in Physadesmia globosa, a diurnal tenebrionid beetle from the Namib desert","Abstract Dehydration (10 days at 26¬∞C) of the Namib tenebrionid beetle Physadesmia globosa resulted in rapid weight loss (approx. 19%), and a substantial decline in haemolymph volume (61%). Although the lipid content decreased significantly during this period, metabolic water production was insufficient to maintain total body water. Rehydration (no food) resulted in increases in body weight and haemolymph volume (sub-normal), and total body water to normality. Haemolymph osmolality, sodium, potassium and chloride concentrations increased during dehydration, but despite a marked decrease in the volume of haemolymph, changes in these parameters were subject to osmoregulatory control. Protein concentrations increased during dehydration and decreased during rehydration. Rapid rehydration (1 h) is well-controlled: while haemolymph volume increased dramatically, haemolymph osmolality, sodium, potassium and chloride were strongly regulated. However, extended rehydration (over 4 days) appears not to be as well managed by Physadesmia, with haemolymph osmolality and sodium concentrations decreasing despite no significant change in haemolymph volume from immediate post-rehydration (1 h) values. The potassium and chloride concentrations, however, appeared to be under stricter control during this period. Drinking (when fog water is available) probably contributes largely to the total water input of Physadesmia, and this together with efficient water conservation must serve to maintain effectively long-term water balance in these insects.",TRUE
"Water homeostasis in bees, with the emphasis on sociality","SUMMARY Avenues of water gain and loss in bees are examined here at two levels of organisation: the individual and the colony. Compared with the majority of terrestrial insects, bees have a high water turnover. This is due to their nectar diet and, in larger species, substantial metabolic water production during flight, counteracted by high evaporative and excretory losses. Water fluxes at the colony level can also be very high. When incoming nectar is dilute, honeybees need to remove large volumes of water by evaporation. On the other hand, water is not stored in the nest and must be collected for evaporative cooling and for feeding the brood. Water regulation has many similarities at individual and colony levels. In particular, manipulation of nectar or water on the tongue is extensively used by bees to increase evaporation for either food-concentrating or cooling purposes.",TRUE
Water relations of tetrapod integument,"SUMMARY The vertebrate integument represents an evolutionary compromise between the needs for mechanical protection and those of sensing the environment and regulating the exchange of materials and energy. Fibrous keratins evolved as a means of strengthening the integument while simultaneously providing a structural support for lipids, which comprise the principal barrier to cutaneous water efflux in terrestrial taxa. Whereas lipids are of fundamental importance to water barriers, the efficacy of these barriers depends in many cases on structural features that enhance or maintain the integrity of function. Amphibians are exceptional among tetrapods in having very little keratin and a thin stratum corneum. Thus, effective lipid barriers that are present in some specialized anurans living in xeric habitats are external to the epidermis, whereas lipid barriers of amniotes exist as a lipid-keratin complex within the stratum corneum. Amphibians prevent desiccation of the epidermis and underlying tissues either by evaporating water from a superficial aqueous film, which must be replenished, or by shielding the stratum corneum with superficial lipids. Water barrier function in vertebrates generally appears to be relatively fixed, although various species have `plasticity' to adjust the barrier effectiveness facultatively. While it is clear that both phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation can account for covariation between environment and skin resistance to water efflux, studies of the relative importance of these two phenomena are few. Fundamental mechanisms for adjusting the skin water barrier include changes in barrier thickness, composition and physicochemical properties of cutaneous lipids, and/or geometry of the barrier within the epidermis. While cutaneous lipids have been studied extensively in the contexts of disease and cosmetics, relatively little is known about the processes of permeability barrier ontogenesis related to adaptation and environment. Advances in such knowledge have didactic significance for understanding vertebrate evolution as well as practical application to clinical dermatology.",TRUE
Wet but not slippery: boundary friction in tree frog adhesive toe pads,"Tree frogs are remarkable for their capacity to cling to smooth surfaces using large toe pads. The adhesive skin of tree frog toe pads is characterized by peg-studded hexagonal cells separated by deep channels into which mucus glands open. The pads are completely wetted with watery mucus, which led previous authors to suggest that attachment is solely due to capillary and viscous forces generated by the fluid-filled joint between the pad and the substrate. Here, we present evidence from single-toe force measurements, laser tweezer microrheometry of pad mucus and interference reflection microscopy of the contact zone in Litoria caerulea, that tree frog attachment forces are significantly enhanced by close contacts and boundary friction between the pad epidermis and the substrate, facilitated by the highly regular pad microstructure.",TRUE
Wet mammals shake at tuned frequencies to dry,"In cold wet weather, mammals face hypothermia if they cannot dry themselves.

We here report the power law relationship between shaking frequency f and body mass M to be f ‚àº M‚àí0.22, which is close to our prediction of f ‚àº M‚àí0.19 based upon the balance of centrifugal and capillary forces.

WHEN DOES MOTION RELATIVE TO NEIGHBORING SURFACES ALTER THE FLOW THROUGH ARRAYS OF HAIRS?,"Many animals from different phyla use structures bearing arrays of hairs to perform a variety of important functions, such as olfaction, gas exchange, suspension feeding and locomotion. The performance of all these functions depends on the motion of water or air around and through these arrays of hairs. Because organisms often move such hair-bearing appendages with respect to their bodies or the substratum, we assessed the effects of such motion relative to walls on the fluid flow between neighboring hairs. We compared flow fields near dynamically scaled physical models of hairs moving near walls with those calculated for such hairs in an unbounded fluid. Our results suggest that the methods an organism can use to change the flow through a hair-bearing appendage differ with Reynolds number (based on hair diameter). When Re is 10(-2) or below, changing speed does not alter the proportion of the fluid that moves through rather than around the array, whereas moving relative to a wall increases it. In contrast, when Re is between 10(-2) and 1, changes in speed have a big effect on the proportion of fluid moving through the array, while moving near walls makes little difference.",TRUE

Hydrophobicity of pennae, Cassie-Baxter wetting hypothesis and Cassie-Wenzel capillarity-induced wetting transition.","Wetting of pigeon feathers has been studied. It was demonstrated that the Cassie-Baxter wetting regime is inherent for pigeon pennae. The water drop, supported by network formed by barbs and barbules, sits partially on air pockets. Small static apparent angle hysteresis justifies the Cassie-Baxter wetting hypothesis. A twofold structure of a feather favors large contact angles and provides its water repellency.

Why Do Woodpeckers Resist Head Impact Injury: A Biomechanical Investigation,"Head injury is a leading cause of morbidity and death in both industrialized and developing countries. It is estimated that brain injuries account for 15% of the burden of fatalities and disabilities, and represent the leading cause of death in young adults. Brain injury may be caused by an impact or a sudden change in the linear and/or angular velocity of the head. However, the woodpecker does not experience any head injury at the high speed of 6‚Äì7 m/s with a deceleration of 1000 g when it drums a tree trunk. It is still not known how woodpeckers protect their brain from impact injury. In order to investigate this, two synchronous high-speed video systems were used to observe the pecking process, and the force sensor was used to measure the peck force. The mechanical properties and macro/micro morphological structure in woodpecker's head were investigated using a mechanical testing system and micro-CT scanning. Finite element (FE) models of the woodpecker's head were established to study the dynamic intracranial responses. The result showed that macro/micro morphology of cranial bone and beak can be recognized as a major contributor to non-impact-injuries. This biomechanical analysis makes it possible to visualize events during woodpecker pecking and may inspire new approaches to prevention and treatment of human head injury.",TRUE
Why the seahorse tail is square,"The curious tale of the square tail Appendages in animals are typically round, but the seahorse tail has a square cross section. Porter et al. hypothesize that this shape provides better functionality and strength than a round cross section (see the Perspective by Ashley-Ross). Three-dimensional printed models show that square cross section shapes behave more advantageously when subjected to compressive forces. By allowing greater deformation without damage and accommodating twisting deformations, square appendages passively return to their original configurations. The added flexibility of the square cross section enhances the tail's ability to grasp objects. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aaa6683; see also p. 30 3D-printed models show that square profile seahorse tails have better crush resistance and grasping ability than do circular ones. [Also see Perspective by Ashley-Ross] INTRODUCTION Although the predominant shapes of most animal tails are cylindrical, seahorse tails are square prisms. The skeleton of their tails consists of a bony armor arranged into several ringlike segments composed of four L-shaped plates that surround a central vertebra. These plates articulate with specialized joints that facilitate bending and twisting, as well as resist vertebral fracture from crushing. Muscles attached to the vertebral column transmit forces to the bony plates to provide motion for grasping and holding on to objects such as sea grasses, mangrove roots, and coral reefs, which allows them to hide and rely on camouflage when evading predators and capturing prey. RATIONALE We hypothesize that the square cross-sectional architecture of a seahorse tail improves mechanical performance in prehension (grasping ability) and armored functions (crushing resistance), relative to a cylindrical one. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the mechanics of two three-dimensional (3D)‚Äìprinted prototypes composed of articulating plates and vertebrae that mimic the natural (square prism) and a hypothetical (cylindrical) tail structure. We compared the bending, twisting, and compressive behavior of the biomimetic prototypes to show that the square profile is better than the circular one for two integrated functions: grasping ability and crushing resistance. RESULTS Seahorse tails (and the prototypes) have three primary joints that enable motion: ball-and-socket, peg-and-socket, and gliding. The ball-and-socket joints connect adjacent vertebrae and constrain bending in both the square and cylindrical prototypes to the same degree, exhibiting a behavior similar to that of a natural seahorse tail. The peg-and-socket joints connect the plates of adjacent segments and substantially restrict twisting in the prototype with a square profile, as compared with the circular one. The square geometry limits excessive torsion and preserves articulatory organization, which could provide seahorses a natural safety factor against torsion-induced damage and assist in tail relaxation. Further, the square architecture is flat (increasing surface contact) and undergoes an exterior shape change when twisted, which could allow seahorses to grasp objects with more control. Gliding joints are present at the plate overlaps along all four sides of both prototypes. Under transverse compression and impact (with a rubber mallet), the plates of the square prototype slide past one another with one degree of translation freedom (analogous to the crushing behavior of a natural seahorse tail), exhibiting a response that is stiffer, stronger, and more resilient than its cylindrical counterpart, whose plates translate and rotate on impact. CONCLUSION Exploration of these biologically inspired designs provides insight into the mechanical benefits for seahorses to have evolved prehensile tails composed of armored plates organized into square prisms. Beyond their intended practical applications, engineering designs are convenient means to answer elusive biological questions when live animal data are unavailable (for example, seahorses do not have cylindrical tails). Understanding the role of mechanics in these prototypes may help engineers to develop future seahorse-inspired technologies that mimic the prehensile and armored functions of the natural appendage for a variety of applications in robotics, defense systems, or biomedicine. Engineering designs answer biological questions. 3D-printed models that mimic a seahorse tail were designed not only for potential engineering applications but also to answer the biological question, why might tails organized into square prisms be better than cylinders? A mechanical comparison of the prototypes shows that articulated square prisms perform better than do cylinders for grasping and resistance to crushing. Whereas the predominant shapes of most animal tails are cylindrical, seahorse tails are square prisms. Seahorses use their tails as flexible grasping appendages, in spite of a rigid bony armor that fully encases their bodies. We explore the mechanics of two three-dimensional‚Äìprinted models that mimic either the natural (square prism) or hypothetical (cylindrical) architecture of a seahorse tail to uncover whether or not the square geometry provides any functional advantages. Our results show that the square prism is more resilient when crushed and provides a mechanism for preserving articulatory organization upon extensive bending and twisting, as compared with its cylindrical counterpart. Thus, the square architecture is better than the circular one in the context of two integrated functions: grasping ability and crushing resistance.",TRUE
Why tree-crop interactions in agroforestry appear at odds with tree-grass interactions in tropical savannahs,"This paper describes recent research findings on resource sharing between trees and crops in the semiarid tropics and attempts to reconcile this information with current knowledge of the interactions between savannah trees and understorey vegetation by examining agroforestry systems from the perspective of succession. In general, productivity of natural vegetation under savannah trees increases as rainfall decreases, while the opposite occurs in agroforestry. One explanation is that in the savannah, the beneficial effects of microclimatic improvements (e.g. lower temperatures and evaporation losses) are greater in more xeric environments. Mature savannah trees have a high proportion of woody above-ground structure compared to foliage, so that the amount of water 'saved' (largely by reduction in soil evaporation) is greater than water 'lost' through transpiration by trees. By contrast, in agroforestry practices such as alley cropping where tree density is high, any beneficial effects of the trees on microclimate are negated by reductions in soil moisture due to increasing interception losses and tree transpiration. While investment in woody structure can improve the water economy beneath agroforestry trees, it inevitably reduces the growth rate of the trees and thus increases the time required for improved understorey productivity. Therefore, agroforesters prefer trees with more direct and immediate benefits to farmers. The greatest opportunity for simultaneous agroforestry practices is therefore to fill niches within the landscape where resources are currently under-utilised by crops. In this way, agroforestry can mimic the large scale patch dynamics and successional progression of a natural ecosystem.",TRUE
Wild hummingbirds discriminate nonspectral colors,"Significance Birds have four color cone types in their eyes, compared to three in humans. In theory, this enables birds to discriminate a broad range of colors, including many nonspectral colors. Nonspectral colors are perceived when nonadjacent cone types (sensitive to widely separated parts of the light spectrum) are predominantly stimulated. For humans, purple (stimulation of blue- and red-sensitive cones) is a nonspectral color; birds‚Äô fourth color cone type creates many more possibilities. We trained wild hummingbirds to participate in color vision tests, which revealed that they can discriminate a variety of nonspectral colors, including UV+red, UV+green, purple, and UV+yellow. Additionally, based on an analysis of ‚àº3,300 plumage and plant colors, we estimate that birds perceive many natural colors as nonspectral. Many animals have the potential to discriminate nonspectral colors. For humans, purple is the clearest example of a nonspectral color. It is perceived when two color cone types in the retina (blue and red) with nonadjacent spectral sensitivity curves are predominantly stimulated. Purple is considered nonspectral because no monochromatic light (such as from a rainbow) can evoke this simultaneous stimulation. Except in primates and bees, few behavioral experiments have directly examined nonspectral color discrimination, and little is known about nonspectral color perception in animals with more than three types of color photoreceptors. Birds have four color cone types (compared to three in humans) and might perceive additional nonspectral colors such as UV+red and UV+green. Can birds discriminate nonspectral colors, and are these colors behaviorally and ecologically relevant? Here, using comprehensive behavioral experiments, we show that wild hummingbirds can discriminate a variety of nonspectral colors. We also show that hummingbirds, relative to humans, likely perceive a greater proportion of natural colors as nonspectral. Our analysis of plumage and plant spectra reveals many colors that would be perceived as nonspectral by birds but not by humans: Birds‚Äô extra cone type allows them not just to see UV light but also to discriminate additional nonspectral colors. Our results support the idea that birds can distinguish colors throughout tetrachromatic color space and indicate that nonspectral color perception is vital for signaling and foraging. Since tetrachromacy appears to have evolved early in vertebrates, this capacity for rich nonspectral color perception is likely widespread.",TRUE
Wood frog adaptations to overwintering in Alaska: new limits to freezing tolerance,"We investigated the ecological physiology and behavior of free-living wood frogs [Lithobates (Rana) sylvaticus] overwintering in Interior Alaska by tracking animals into natural hibernacula, recording microclimate, and determining frog survival in spring. We measured cryoprotectant (glucose) concentrations and identified the presence of antifreeze glycolipids in tissues from subsamples of naturally freezing frogs. We also recorded the behavior of wood frogs preparing to freeze in artificial hibernacula, and tissue glucose concentrations in captive wood frogs frozen in the laboratory to ‚àí2.5¬∞C. Wood frogs in natural hibernacula remained frozen for 193¬±11 consecutive days and experienced average (October‚ÄìMay) temperatures of ‚àí6.3¬∞C and average minimum temperatures of ‚àí14.6¬±2.8¬∞C (range ‚àí8.9 to ‚àí18.1¬∞C) with 100% survival (N=18). Mean glucose concentrations were 13-fold higher in muscle, 10-fold higher in heart and 3.3-fold higher in liver in naturally freezing compared with laboratory frozen frogs. Antifreeze glycolipid was present in extracts from muscle and internal organs, but not skin, of frozen frogs. Wood frogs in Interior Alaska survive freezing to extreme limits and durations compared with those described in animals collected in southern Canada or the Midwestern United States. We hypothesize that this enhancement of freeze tolerance in Alaskan wood frogs is due to higher cryoprotectant levels that are produced by repeated freezing and thawing cycles experienced under natural conditions during early autumn.",TRUE
Worms bask in extreme temperatures,"Temperature is one of the most important environmental factors that governs a species' distribution. Some highly specialized prokaryotes can grow at temperatures above 113 ¬∞C (ref. 1), but eukaryotes appear less versatile and do not normally occur above 55 ¬∞C. Here we show that a colony-dwelling polychaete worm, inhabiting deep-sea hydrothermal vent chimneys, regularly experiences temperatures above 80 ¬∞C and a thermal gradient of 60 ¬∞C or more over its body length.",TRUE
Xylanases of marine fungi of potential use for biobleaching of paper pulp,"Microbial xylanases that are thermostable, active at alkaline pH and cellulase-free are generally preferred for biobleaching of paper pulp. We screened obligate and facultative marine fungi for xylanase activity with these desirable traits. Several fungal isolates obtained from marine habitats showed alkaline xylanase activity. The crude enzyme from NIOCC isolate 3 (Aspergillus niger), with high xylanase activity, cellulase-free and unique properties containing 580¬†U¬†l‚àí1 xylanase, could bring about bleaching of sugarcane bagasse pulp by a 60¬†min treatment at 55¬∞C, resulting in a decrease of ten kappa numbers and a 30% reduction in consumption of chlorine during bleaching. The culture filtrate showed peaks of xylanase activity at pH 3.5 and pH 8.5. When assayed at pH¬†3.5, optimum activity was detected at 50¬∞C, with a second peak of activity at 90¬∞C. When assayed at pH¬†8.5, optimum activity was seen at 80¬∞C. The crude enzyme was thermostable at 55¬∞C for at least 4¬†h and retained about 60% activity. Gel filtration of the 50‚Äì80% ammonium sulphate-precipitated fraction of the crude culture filtrate separated into two peaks of xylanase with specific activities of 393 and 2,457¬†U¬†(mg protein)‚àí1. The two peaks showing xylanase activity had molecular masses of 13 and 18¬†kDa. Zymogram analysis of xylanase of crude culture filtrate as well as the 50‚Äì80% ammonium sulphate-precipitated fraction showed two distinct xylanase activity bands on native PAGE. The crude culture filtrate also showed moderate activities of Œ≤-xylosidase and Œ±-l-arabinofuranosidase, which could act synergistically with xylanase in attacking xylan. This is the first report showing the potential application of crude culture filtrate of a marine fungal isolate possessing thermostable, cellulase-free alkaline xylanase activity in biobleaching of paper pulp.",TRUE
Xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase (XET) functions in gelatinous layers of tension wood fibers in poplar--a glimpse into the mechanism of the balancing act of trees,"Tension wood is a specialized tissue of deciduous trees that functions in bending woody stems to optimize their position in space. Tension wood fibers that develop on one side of the stem have an increased potency to shrink compared with fibers on the opposite side, thus creating a bending moment. It is believed that the gelatinous (G) cell wall layer containing almost pure cellulose of tension wood fibers is pivotal to their shrinking. By analyzing saccharide composition and linkage in isolated G-layers of poplar, we found that they contain some matrix components in addition to cellulose, of which xyloglucan is the most abundant. Xyloglucan, xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase (XET) activity and xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase/hydrolase (XTH) gene products were detected in developing G-layers by labeling using CCRC-M1 monoclonal antibody, in situ incorporation of XXXG-SR and the polyclonal antibody to poplar PttXET16-34, respectively, indicating that xyloglucan is incorporated into the G-layer during its development. Moreover, several XTH transcripts were altered and were generally up-regulated in developing tension wood compared with normal wood. In mature G-fibers, XTH gene products were detected in the G-layers while the XET activity was evident in the adjacent S(2) wall layer. We propose that XET activity is essential for G-fiber shrinking by repairing xyloglucan cross-links between G- and S(2)-layers and thus maintaining their contact. Surprisingly, XTH gene products and XET activity persisted in mature G-fibers for several years, suggesting that the enzyme functions after cell death repairing the cross-links as they are being broken during the shrinking process.",TRUE
