Though structures of individual rhabdovirus proteins have been reported, how these are organized into a bullet shape has remained unclear. Now, Ge et al. (p. 689) report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of a model rhabdovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus. The structural data and examination of mutants allows modeling of virion assembly. The structure of a negative-strand RNA virus suggests how bullet-shaped rhabdoviruses assemble. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a bullet-shaped rhabdovirus and a model system of negative-strand RNA viruses. Through direct visualization by means of cryo\u201a\u00c4\u00ecelectron microscopy, we show that each virion contains two nested, left-handed helices: an outer helix of matrix protein M and an inner helix of nucleoprotein N and RNA. M has a hub domain with four contact sites that link to neighboring M and N subunits, providing rigidity by clamping adjacent turns of the nucleocapsid. Side-by-side interactions between neighboring N subunits are critical for the nucleocapsid to form a bullet shape, and structure-based mutagenesis results support this description. Together, our data suggest a mechanism of VSV assembly in which the nucleocapsid spirals from the tip to become the helical trunk, both subsequently framed and rigidified by the M layer.\"\nMANAGE_STRESS/STRAIN|PREVENT_DEFORMATION|PROTECT_FROM_LOSS_OF_LIQUIDS|PROTECT_FROM_MICROBES,\"Biochemical analysis of elastic and rigid cuticles of Cirsium horridulum Abstract. The cuticle is a complex structure of soluble lipids, lipid polymers and polysaccharides. In addition to its functions to reduce water loss and provide a protective barrier, its mechanical properties may be significant to plant growth and development. We investigated the cuticle of Cirsium horridulum Michx. because of its involvement in the thigmonastic contraction of staminal filaments. The staminal filaments and portions of the style are surrounded by a highly elastic cuticle in contrast to the rigid cuticle of the corolla and leaves. Our aim was to determine if the biochemical composition affected the elasticity of the cuticle. We discovered that the ratio of carbohydrates to lipids is 1:7 in floral parts but 2:\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "sciphi/triplex:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "n": null}}
