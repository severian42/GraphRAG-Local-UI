The muscle activity that bends the body and produces these movements during steady, continuous swimming can cost a significant amount of energy. But some fishes, such as rainbow trout, can adopt a special swimming behavior that likely enables them to save their own energy by extracting energy from nearby water vortices.\n\nIn a fluid environment, vortices are swirls of water or air often released (or \u201cshed\u201d) from stationary objects and other living creatures, including other fish, that are in the path of an oncoming flow.\n\nTrout use water vortices that come their way from upstream sources to their advantage by adjusting their typical swimming behavior to produce a\n\n\u2018slalom\u2019 movement between vortices. Body bends\n\nincrease in amplitude and curvature, and the tail beats at a frequency that matches the frequency at which vortices are shed upstream. The pattern of muscle activity along the body also changes, Image: \u00a9Biomimicry Institute\n\nwhere only muscles close to the head are active.\n\n\u00a92022 Biomimicry Institute\n\nBiomimicry.org | AskNature.org\n\n\n\n\n\nBIOLOGICAL STRATEGY\n\nThis differs from typical undulating motion where The general concept of taking advantage of muscles contract all along the body, starting altered fluid flows behind other objects to reduce from the head and moving toward the tail to the energetic cost of motion is found in human produce a traveling body wave that pushes the behaviors too, for instance, in cyclists that draft fish forward.
