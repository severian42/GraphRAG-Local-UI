{"result": " To become a skilled negotiator, you need to develop the following strategies:\n\n1. Preparation and Research: Understand your objectives and priorities before entering the negotiation process. Identify what is most important for both parties involved and know the subject matter thoroughly. Knowledge of industry standards or market values can be extremely helpful in this step. \n\n2. Active Listening: Pay close attention to what the other party says, demonstrating that you are interested in understanding their perspective fully before expressing your own views. This helps build rapport and trust which is crucial for effective negotiation.\n   \n3. Empathy and Emotion Management: Be mindful of the emotions at play during a discussion as it can have significant impact on the outcome. Try to understand the other person's point of view, their motivations, fears and interests. This helps in addressing concerns effectively while ensuring that the conversation remains civil and constructive.\n   \n4. Communicate Clearly: Be articulate about your needs and wants without being aggressive or overbearing. Use \"I\" statements to express what you are seeking clearly. Avoid making assumptions, instead ask clarifying questions when necessary. \n\n5. Flexibility: It's essential not to be rigid in negotiations as this could close off potential compromise solutions that might satisfy both parties involved. Be open to creative options and alternatives for reaching a mutual agreement.\n   \n6. Patience: Don\u2019t rush the process, give yourself ample time to think about the best possible solution. \n\n7. Confidence: Walk into negotiations with confidence in your worth or value but also be open to learn from each experience and adapt accordingly for future interactions.\n\n8. Win-Win mindset: Always aim for a win-win situation where both parties feel they've gained something of value. This builds long term relationships which is often more beneficial than securing immediate gains.\n\n9. Be professional: Regardless of the outcome, maintain your composure and conduct yourself in a way that preserves the relationship for potential future negotiations. \n\n10. Practice Negotiation Skills: The best way to improve negotiation skills is through practice. Seek out opportunities where you can engage with others in negotiations to fine-tune your approach and techniques, based on different scenarios and responses. This could be role-playing exercises or actual business situations.\n\nRemember that the art of negotiation requires a balance between assertiveness and empathy, while keeping an open mind for alternatives and compromise where necessary.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

Thus, it will be possible to cover an even greater number of works, which may lead to relevant developments for the scientific and professional communities.\n\nIn summary, with this review, it is necessary to emphasize the importance of adopting interdisciplinary knowledge in the field of design to expand the creative perspectives of professionals and to diversify theories, approaches, and resources. In this sense, biomimicry has shown itself to be an area of great potential for projects in design. In this work, the expression \u201cbiomimetic design\u201d was generically adopted when analyzing publications from the intersection between the design and biomimicry domains. However, it is necessary to understand that further efforts are needed in favor of more \u2018genuinely\u2019 biomimetic designs, developed in the specific field of design, in which, throughout the entire creative process of products and services, the concepts, principles, and creative tools of biomimicry are effectively integrated.\n\nUnlike technologies that require specific procedures, authorizations, investments, and monetization for access, nature is an extensive (and more accessible) repository of resources that can be investigated and interpreted by human beings, which can complement and expand current practices in design. Furthermore, as evidenced by several authors, the field of design is plural and interdisciplinary, as it seeks to enable creations for different areas of human endeavor [1\u20134, 50\u201355]. Including the perspective of biomimicry in teaching and professional practice scenarios in design can expand creative horizons, allowing the creation of innovative solutions that are more efficient, economical, and better adapted to consumer needs and environmental diversity [6, 55,56].\n\nFinally, as the study of aspects of biomimicry in design can enhance the development of multiple skills (such as creative and conceptual generation, observation and research, study of materials, graphic expression, and three-dimensional conception and digital modeling), it is important to recognize that understanding nature and knowing how to explore its resources are indispensable requirements for contemporary professional training, since they can encourage creativity as well as the integration of ecological and sustainable factors in production cycles.\n\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 61\n\n14 of 16\n\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.A.M.d.S.; methodology,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "phi3:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 8192, "n": null}}
