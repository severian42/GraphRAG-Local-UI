{"result": " To create an intricate web of clues for a mystery novel, you will need to design a puzzle that is challenging yet solvable. Here are the steps and considerations you can take:\n\n1. Identify your core plot and characters - Establish what kind of story you want to tell. Determine who the protagonist and antagonist or suspects will be, along with other major players in the narrative. Each character should have clear motives for wanting to solve the mystery or potentially hide it.\n2. Develop your crime scene: Set a stage that is complex but logical in nature, leaving room for exploration and deduction by your protagonist. It could be a murder, theft, disappearance etc., with no immediate answers.\n3. Plan multiple red herrings - These are misleading clues which lead readers on wild goose chases while the real culprit is in plain sight or cleverly hidden. They add to complexity and keep the reader guessing till the end.\n4. Create a timeline: A timeline can help structure your storyline, keeping it consistent for both you and your readers as they follow along.\n5. Develop connections between characters - There should be intricate relationships that tie everyone together, making every character seem suspicious at some point to create tension in the plot.\n6. Introduce clues gradually: Don't reveal all information upfront. Spread your major and minor clues throughout the story to keep readers hooked till they can piece them together. \n7. Include foreshadowing subtly: It makes the final revelation more satisfying, as well-placed hints will make sense when put in perspective at the end.\n8. Create an unexpected twist - This keeps your reader on their toes and increases suspense levels dramatically. Remember that this should not be too far-fetched but rather plausible within the context of the narrative you have built so far. \n9. Reveal clues through different characters' perspectives: This helps keep the readers engaged, as they must interpret and compare each character's version of events to unravel the truth.\n10. Write a believable resolution - The answer should be something that can convincingly fit in with all previously revealed information but was overlooked due to its clever concealment or misdirection.\n   \nRemember, creating an intricate web of clues is about striking a balance between providing enough hints for your readers to solve the mystery while also maintaining suspense and surprise till the end.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Further, ribs effectively draw stress from weaker areas pierced by podial pores, and increase the total load which can be sustained.Allometry indicates that regular echinoids become relatively higher at the apex as size increases, thus reducing ambital stresses. Some spatangoids with very high domes (eg Agassizia) maintain isometry, but others (eg Meoma) become flatter with size. Both holectypoids (Echinoneus) and cassiduloids (Apatopygus) maintain a constant height to diameter relationship. Flattening, and consequently ambital tensile stress, is greatest in the clypeasteroids. In this group the formation of internal buttresses which preferentially carry stress, reaches maximum development. A notable exception, however, is the high domed Clypeaster rosaceus.In this analysis it was assumed that local buckling or bending does not occur. The test of some echinoids (e.g. Diadematoida) have relatively wide sutures swathed in collagen, which allows local deformation. Others (e.g. Arbacia) have rigid sutures with reduced collagen. In Psammechinus and other members of the Order Echinoida, in addition to rib formation, inner and outer surface trabeculae are thickened so that the individual plates are stiffened. Some spatangoids (Meoma, Paleopneustes) have extensive sutural collagen, but the cassiduloid Apatopygus has collagen confined to junctions of sutures, and elsewhere the joints are strengthened and stiffened by fusion of trabeculae. Fusion of surface trabeculae is almost complete in the holectypoid, Echinoneus, and the sutures are obscured.\",TRUE\nDragon fish see using chlorophyll,\"Most deep-sea fish have visual pigments that are most sensitive to wavelengths around 460-490 nm, the intensity maxima of both conventional blue bioluminescence and dim residual sunlight.
