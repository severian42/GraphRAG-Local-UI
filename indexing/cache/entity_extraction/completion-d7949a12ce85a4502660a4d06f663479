Parasitism risk decreases towards the centre of the syconium, where inner ovules provide enemy-free space for pollinator offspring. We suggest that the resulting gradient in offspring viability is likely to contribute to selection on pollinators to avoid outer ovules, and by forcing wasps to focus on a subset of ovules, reduces their galling rates. This previously unidentified mechanism may therefore contribute to mutualism persistence independent of additional factors that invoke plant defences against pollinator oviposition, or physiological constraints on pollinators that prevent oviposition in all available ovules.\",TRUE\nA seismic monitoring approach to detect and quantify river sediment mobilization by steelhead redd\u201a\u00c4\u00eabuilding activity,\"The role of spawning salmonids in altering river bed morphology and sediment transport is significant, yet poorly understood.

Based on work over nearly 200 years, it has become generally accepted that two touches of the trap\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s sensory hairs within 30 s, each one generating an action potential, are required to trigger closure of the trap. We developed an electromechanical model, which, however, suggests that under certain circumstances one touch is sufficient to generate two action potentials. Using a force-sensing microrobotic system, we precisely quantified the sensory-hair deflection parameters necessary to trigger trap closure and correlated them with the elicited action potentials in vivo. Our results confirm the model\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s predictions, suggesting that the Venus flytrap may be adapted to a wider range of prey movements than previously assumed.\",TRUE\nA small proportion of Talin molecules transmit forces at developing muscle attachments in vivo,\"Cells in developing organisms are subjected to particular mechanical forces that shape tissues and instruct cell fate decisions. How these forces are sensed and transmitted at the molecular level is therefore an important question, one that has mainly been investigated in cultured cells in vitro. Here, we elucidate how mechanical forces are transmitted in an intact organism. We studied Drosophila muscle attachment sites, which experience high mechanical forces during development and require integrin-mediated adhesion for stable attachment to tendons. Therefore, we quantified molecular forces across the essential integrin-binding protein Talin, which links integrin to the actin cytoskeleton.
