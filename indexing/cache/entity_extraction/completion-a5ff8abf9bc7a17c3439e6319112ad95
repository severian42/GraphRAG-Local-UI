{"result": " To maintain a healthy weight, it's important to combine regular physical activity with balanced nutrition. Here are some tips that can help:\n\n1. Engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily, such as brisk walking or cycling. Aim for activities that you enjoy and can stick to long term.\n2. Monitor your portion sizes by using smaller plates during meals and avoid oversized portions.\n3. Include a variety of fruits and vegetables in your diet, aiming for at least 5 servings per day.\n4. Opt for whole-grain products over refined grains to increase fiber intake which can help with satiety.\n5. Limit sugary drinks like sodas; instead, choose water or unsweetened beverages as your primary sources of hydration.\n6. Be mindful when eating and take the time to savor each bite, this may prevent overeating by increasing satisfaction with smaller portions.\n7. Incorporate lean proteins into meals for a more balanced diet, ensuring you're getting enough nutrients while controlling calorie intake.\n8. Limit the consumption of high-calorie, low-nutrition foods such as fast food and pastries.\n9. Practice regular sleep patterns; sufficient rest is crucial for metabolism regulation.\n10. Stay consistent with your habits, making healthful choices a routine part of everyday life rather than occasional efforts.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.
