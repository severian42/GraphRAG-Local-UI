Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

In this sense, it is pertinent to mention that the publications, which were listed and organized in this review, reflect development in several areas of cutting-edge technology, which is consistent with the innovative tendency intrinsic to the field of biomimicry.\n\nHowever, it is relevant to underscore that there is still a scarcity of works oriented toward the development and use of everyday objects and in the field of services, given that these are two areas of great importance in the design domain. In view of this finding, it is reasonable to assume that more efforts and investments are required in design projects that clearly and consistently recognize their foundation in the principles of biomimicry.\n\nThus, it is crucial to more frequently adopt a biomimicry perspective to research and develop products intended for the daily lives of consumers, in order to guarantee a better quality of life for the users of these objects (e.g., bio-inspired functional and technological improvements of products). This limitation is even more alarming upon verifying that most of the publications retrieved from the Web of Science originate from engineering and architecture schools and departments. As a result, there are not enough projects produced by teams from schools and departments associated exclusively with the field of design. It is possible to assume that the absence of the \u2018design\u2019 filter when searching the Web of Science may constitute a restriction for specific dissemination of works.\n\nAnother trend observed in the present review, highlighted by the analysis of the heat maps, concerns which type of biomimicry-based approach the authors adopted in their projects and research.
