One potential solution to this problem is the use of antibiotics in combination with resistance-modifying agents, compounds that act synergistically with existing antibiotics to resensitize previously resistant bacteria. In this study, 12(S),16\u0152\u00e6-dihydroxycleroda-3,13-dien-15,16-olide, a clerodane diterpene isolated from the medicinal plant Callicarpa americana, was found to synergize with oxacillin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This synergy was confirmed by checkerboard (FICI = 0.125) and time-kill assays, with a sub-inhibitory dose of 12(S),16\u0152\u00e6-dihydroxycleroda-3,13-dien-15,16-olide causing the effective concentration of oxacillin to fall below the susceptibility breakpoint for S. aureus, a > 32-fold decrease in both cases.\",TRUE\nA conserved spider silk domain acts as a molecular switch that controls fibre assembly,\"A huge variety of proteins are able to form fibrillar structures, especially at high protein concentrations. Hence, it is surprising that spider silk proteins can be stored in a soluble form at high concentrations and transformed into extremely stable fibres on demand. Silk proteins are reminiscent of amphiphilic block copolymers containing stretches of polyalanine and glycine-rich polar elements forming a repetitive core flanked by highly conserved non-repetitive amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain comprises a secretion signal, but further functions remain\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "sciphi/triplex:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "n": null}}
