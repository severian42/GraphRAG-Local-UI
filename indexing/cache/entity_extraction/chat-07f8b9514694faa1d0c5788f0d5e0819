{"result": " The text discusses a study on biomimicry, which is the imitation of nature's models, processes, and elements to solve complex human problems. The study was conducted by analyzing publications from 1991 to 2021, focusing on recent research (from 2018 to 2021) using bibliographic coupling analysis.\n\nThe results show that the topics of sustainability, waste management, circular economy, and sustainable development are significant in biomimicry research. These themes are spread across various subjects related to biomimetic design, including city level, construction, object, materials, and surface properties.\n\nThe study also reveals that the exploration of design methodologies and processes interconnected with sustainability factors, eco-design, bio-inspired design, and creative analogies is a notable potential of biomimicry creations and technologies.\n\nIn summary, the text presents a study on biomimicry research focusing on sustainability themes, which are pervasive across various subjects related to biomimetic design. The study used bibliographic coupling analysis to investigate recent research in this field.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

In orange, words focused on principles and practices of sustainable development, waste management, and circular economy stand out. The brown cluster refers to the morphological study of animals such as geckos and beetles. The group in yellow is directed toward investigations on materials and surfaces (e.g., adhesion properties, locomotion). In the purple group, themes linked to the exploration of design methodologies and processes interconnected with sustainability factors, eco-design, bio-inspired design, and the use of creative analogies can be found.\n\nIt is interesting to note that terms related to sustainability were distributed in more than one colored group. It can be inferred that this topic is one of the notable potentials of biomimicry creations and technologies. As such, it permeates many different subjects related to research and production of biomimetic design including a diversity of application scales (city level, construction, object, materials, and surface properties).\n\nOnce the citation, co-citation, co-occurrence, and word cloud prospecting stages were Biomimetics 2023, 8, 61\n\n10 of 16\n\ncompleted\u2014all referring to the period from 1991 to 2021\u2014another temporal filter was used to carry out the bibliographic coupling analysis (years from 2018 to 2021), obtaining a total of 78 publications.
