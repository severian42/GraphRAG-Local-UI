Genicula are formed when calcified cells decalcify and restructure to create flexible tissue. The present study has identified important differences in the main agaran disaccharidic repeating units [\u201a\u00dc\u00ed3)\u201a\u00c4\u00ea\u0152\u2264\u201a\u00c4\u00ead\u201a\u00c4\u00eaGalp (1\u201a\u00dc\u00ed 4)\u201a\u00c4\u00ea\u0152\u00b1\u201a\u00c4\u00eal\u201a\u00c4\u00eaGalp(1\u201a\u00dc\u00ed] synthesized by genicular and intergenicular segments. Based on chemical and spectroscopical analyses, we report that genicular cells from C. cheilosporioides biosynthesize a highly methoxylated galactan at C\u201a\u00c4\u00ea6 position with low levels of branching with xylose side stubs on C\u201a\u00c4\u00ea6 of the [\u201a\u00dc\u00ed3)\u201a\u00c4\u00ea\u0152\u2264\u201a\u00c4\u00ead\u201a\u00c4\u00eaGalp (1\u201a\u00dc\u00ed] units, whereas intergenicular segments produce xylogalactans with high levels of xylose and low levels of 6\u201a\u00c4\u00eaO\u201a\u00c4\u00eamethyl \u0152\u2264\u201a\u00c4\u00ead\u201a\u00c4\u00eaGal units. These data suggest that, during genicular development, xylosyl branched, 3\u201a\u00c4\u00ealinked \u0152\u2264\u201a\u00c4\u00ead\u201a\u00c4\u00eaGalp units present in the xylogalactan backbones from intergenicular walls are mostly replaced by 6\u201a\u00c4\u00eaO\u201a\u00c4\u00eamethyl\u201a\u00c4\u00ead\u201a\u00c4\u00eagalactose units. We speculate that this structural shift is a consequence of a putative and specific methoxyl transferase that blocks the xylosylation on C\u201a\u00c4\u00ea6 of the 3\u201a\u00c4\u00ealinked \u0152\u2264\u201a\u00c4\u00ead\u201a\u00c4\u00eaGalp units. Changes in galactan substitutions may contribute to the distinct mechanical properties of genicula and may lend insight into the calcification process in coralline algae.\"\nMANAGE_SHEAR|MANAGE_STRESS/STRAIN,\"Finite element modeling of shell shape in the freshwater turtle Pseudemys concinna reveals a trade\u201a\u00c4\u00eaoff between mechanical strength and hydro\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "sciphi/triplex:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "n": null}}
