Start work/studies at 9 am; set specific tasks for the day.\n  4. Work until 11:30 am, then take a short break (5-10 minutes) to stretch or hydrate.\n  5. Resume work and finish by lunchtime around 1 pm; remember to include time for mindful eating without distractions.\n  6. Take a longer break from 1pm to 2:30 pm, enjoy your meal, and take a brief walk outside if possible.\n  7. Work or study until 4 pm with intermittent short breaks every hour (5 minutes) for stretching or quick relaxation techniques.\n  8. Engage in leisure activities from 4:30 pm to 6 pm; could be reading, hobbies, or spending time with family/friends.\n  9.

Plan for a wind-down routine by 9 pm; this may include light reading, meditation or relaxation exercises before bed.\n  11. Aim to be in bed with no electronics at least one hour before your desired sleep time (8 pm is ideal).\n\nRemember that these are just guidelines and you should tailor them based on what works best for you!\n\nWishing you a balanced day ahead,\n\n{Assistant}", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.
